<meta name="description" content="Update :Microsoft is stopping with public facing websites for new Office 365 clients, existing ones will have another 2 year support. http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-confirms-it-is-dropping-public-website-feature-from-sharepoint-online/ When you buy an Office 365 tenant you get the option to build a Public website within the SharePoint administration panel. Creating a website will give you the following URL by default:  http://[tenant]-public.sharepoint.com.  Within SharePoint 2013 they have extended the options to build massive websites where you had to do a lot of customizations in SharePoint 2010. There are already many site available for example (http://www.motion10.nl ) but most off these websites are build on SharePoint 2013 on premise. This is all because building a public website within Office 365 has a lot of limitations. In this blog post I will try to list the limitations I know. If you find any other limitations or they have changed something on the Office 365 platform to make it work and I haven’t alter the blog post please add a comment or send me a email.

<p><strong>Managed Metadata</strong></p>
<p>As you can see on point 8 within the site settings section you are not able to access the Term Store Management. This also makes it that one off the amazing new features off SharePoint 2013 <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj163978.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">taxonomy-based navigation</a> cannot be used on a Office 365 public website.</p>
<p>Besides that more taxonomy based features do not work as for example the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj656774(v=office.15).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">product catalog</a> functionality.</p>
<p><strong>Sub Sites</strong></p>
<p>From the UI you cannot create a sub site.  You will have to use SharePoint Designer in order to create a sub site. But even then you are not able to use every site template. In my situation I tried to create a Publishing Site and it got immediately deleted from my tenant.</p>
<p>The only templates that can be used on the online version are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Team Site</li>
<li>Basic Search Site</li>
<li>
<strong>Content Search Web Part:</strong>One of the web parts you had to develop for previous version of SharePoint (At least I did) now came to SharePoint 2013 and that is the “<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj163789.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Content Search Web Part</a>”. This web part is not available on the public web site of Office 365.</li>
</ul>
<p>Online you can find great tips to deal with the limitations of the Public website:</p>

<li>Public Website help for Office 365</li>
</ul>
