<meta name="description" content="Last week we finished the installation of SharePoint 2013. For us to test the new version off SharePoint we still have to do some configuration. The first thing we will do is creating a couple of service accounts that we will use to create Service Application and Web Applications. Open Active Directory Users or Computer by doing the following:  Go to the Start Menu by using the Windows button or by going to the low left corner with your mouse.   With the Start Menu open select “Active Directory Users and Computers”.   Open the Users OU and use your other mouse button to add a new user. When you have the “New Object - User” window open create the following user.    First name Last name User Logon name User logon name   SharePoint Application Pool svc_spapppool svc_spapppool   SharePoint Services svc_spservices svc_spservices   SharePoint Search svc_spsearch svc_spsearch   SharePoint Content Access spcontentaccess spcontentaccess    &nbsp; Make sure you select the options, for all of the accounts:  User cannot change password.   Password never expires.   For us to create a new site we will also have to register a url within the DNS (You can also do this within your host file).&nbsp; To alter the DNS configuration do the following:  Go to the Start Menu by using the Windows button or by going to the low left corner with your mouse.   With the Start Menu open select “DNS”.   Select the forward lookup zone of your domain and add a new A Host record. For this machine I chose the following domain: sp2013.dev.local.  For us to access this URL this machine we will also have to disable the LoopBackCheck, this is because Windows Server 2012 also had the same security enabled as Windows Server 2008 R2. To disable the LoopBackCheck check this blog post: http://msftplayground.com/2009/04/access-denied-while-crawling-sites/ Now that we have done these configurations we can start with the last configuration steps off SharePoint. First off we will create some managed accounts: Create Managed Accounts To create managed accounts follow the following steps:  Open “Central Administration”   Go to the Security section.   Select “Configure Managed Accounts”&nbsp; under “General Security”.   Then add managed accounts for all the accounts we created in the AD besides the spcontentaccess account.    With the managed accounts in place it is time to create our web application. Create Web Application To create a new web application follow these steps:  With “Central Administration” opened go to the “Application Management” section.   Select “Manage web applications”.   On the toolbar select “New”&nbsp; within the toolbar.   Create the web application with the following information.      Setting Value   IIS Web Site Create a new IIS web site.

When the web application is created we will define some managed paths to create site collections. Define Managed Paths  With “Central Administration” opened go to the “Application Management” section.   Select “Manage web applications”.   Select the web application for which you want to define the managed paths.   On the toolbar select “Managed Paths” within the toolbar.   In the Define Managed Paths window add the following Managed Paths:      Path Type   personal Explicit   hub Explicit   content Explicit    &nbsp; With the Managed Paths in place it is time to create a few site collections. Create Site Collections First off we will create a MySite host site collection. To start creating site collections follow these steps:  With “Central Administration” opened go to the “Application Management” section.   Select &quot;Create Site Collections&quot;   Make the site collection with the following information:      Setting Value   Web Application Make sure the right web application is selected   Title and Description Title: SP2013 MySite Description: MySite Host   Web Site Address Url: http://sp2013.dev.local/personal    Template Selection Enterprise - My Site Host   Site Collection Administrators Choose the users you want to administrator the site collection. For this machine we will use dev\spadmin    &nbsp; Creating a site collection with these settings will create a my site host. We will also create a Team site and a Hub site.

Type: “New-SPStateServiceApplication”   Next enter the name for the service application “Name : State Service Application”   With all the Service applications in place we will perform a IISReset make sure that all settings are refreshed. After the IISReset we can start the service by going to the following screen:  Open “Central Administration”   Select “Application Management”   Then select “Manage services on server”   With the Services screen open start the following services:  App Management Service   Business Data Connectivity Service   Claims to Windows Token Service   Machine Translation Service   Managed Metadata Web Service   Request Management   Secure Store Service   User Profile Service   Work Management Service   When these services are started we will make the farm account (svc_spfarm) local administrator. This is because off the same problem with SharePoint 2010. To make the svc_spfarm account local administrator do the following: Open Active Directory Users or Computer by doing the following:  Go to the Start Menu by using the Windows button or by going to the low left corner with your mouse.   With the Start Menu open select “Active Directory Users and Computers”.   With Active Directory Users and Computers open open the domain and select the Builtin OU.   Within the Builtin OU find the administrators group and add the farm account to it.   Perform a reset off your VM to reset the security of the farm account. Then go back the “Manage services on server” and start the “User Profile Synchronization Service”. When you will start this service you will have to connect it to a Service Application. Connect it to the User Profile Service application we created above. With all these service applications and web applications in place you have a great environment to start testing SharePoint 2013.

Type: “New-SPStateServiceApplication”   Next enter the name for the service application “Name : State Service Application”   With all the Service applications in place we will perform a IISReset make sure that all settings are refreshed. After the IISReset we can start the service by going to the following screen:  Open “Central Administration”   Select “Application Management”   Then select “Manage services on server”   With the Services screen open start the following services:  App Management Service   Business Data Connectivity Service   Claims to Windows Token Service   Machine Translation Service   Managed Metadata Web Service   Request Management   Secure Store Service   User Profile Service   Work Management Service   When these services are started we will make the farm account (svc_spfarm) local administrator. This is because off the same problem with SharePoint 2010. To make the svc_spfarm account local administrator do the following: Open Active Directory Users or Computer by doing the following:  Go to the Start Menu by using the Windows button or by going to the low left corner with your mouse.   With the Start Menu open select “Active Directory Users and Computers”.   With Active Directory Users and Computers open open the domain and select the Builtin OU.   Within the Builtin OU find the administrators group and add the farm account to it.   Perform a reset off your VM to reset the security of the farm account. Then go back the “Manage services on server” and start the “User Profile Synchronization Service”. When you will start this service you will have to connect it to a Service Application. Connect it to the User Profile Service application we created above. With all these service applications and web applications in place you have a great environment to start testing SharePoint 2013.

    <meta itemprop="headline" content="Install SharePoint 2013 Public Beta on Windows Server 2012 RC – Part VI – Configuring SharePoint 2013 on Windows Server 2012 RC">
    <meta itemprop="description" content='Last week we finished the installation of SharePoint 2013. For us to test the new version off SharePoint we still have to do some configuration.The first thing we will do is creating a couple of service accounts that we will use to create Service Application and Web Applications.Open Active Directory Users or Computer by doing the following:Go to the Start Menu by using the Windows button or by going to the low left corner with your mouse.  With the Start Menu open select “Active Directory Users and Computers”. Open the Users OU and use your other mouse button to add a new user. When you have the “New Object - User” window open create the following user.First nameLast nameUser Logon nameUser logon nameSharePointApplication Poolsvc_spapppoolsvc_spapppoolSharePointServicessvc_spservicessvc_spservicesSharePointSearchsvc_spsearchsvc_spsearchSharePointContent Accessspcontentaccessspcontentaccess Make sure you select the options, for all of the accounts:User cannot change password.  Password never expires. For us to create a new site we will also have to register a url within the DNS (You can also do this within your host file).  To alter the DNS configuration do the following:Go to the Start Menu by using the Windows button or by going to the low left corner with your mouse.  With the Start Menu open select “DNS”. Select the forward lookup zone of your domain and add a new A Host record. For this machine I chose the following domain: sp2013.dev.local.For us to access this URL this machine we will also have to disable the LoopBackCheck, this is because Windows Server 2012 also had the same security enabled as Windows Server 2008 R2. To disable the LoopBackCheck check this blog post:http://msftplayground.com/2009/04/access-denied-while-crawling-sites/Now that we have done these configurations we can start with the last configuration steps off SharePoint. First off we will create some managed accounts:Create Managed AccountsTo create managed accounts follow the following steps:Open “Central Administration”  Go to the Security section.  Select “Configure Managed Accounts”  under “General Security”.  Then add managed accounts for all the accounts we created in the AD besides the spcontentaccess account. With the managed accounts in place it is time to create our web application.Create Web ApplicationTo create a new web application follow these steps:With “Central Administration” opened go to the “Application Management” section.

This is also one off the new service applications. The work management service application will give users the ability to edit and change there tasks on one single place within the SharePoint farm. This service will take care of changing values on other places and aggregating the tasks. One off the great things it is also possible to synchronize exchange tasks!!!To create the Work Management Service follow these steps:With “Central Administration” opened go to the “Application Management” section.  Select “Manage Service Applications”.  On the toolbar select "New" and select “Work management Service Application"  Create the Application with the following settings. SettingValueNameWork Management Service ApplicationApplication PoolUse existing application pool: Application pool name: SharePoint Service Application PoolService Application ProxySelect create proxy for this service application. This were all off the service application we will create trough the UI will will have to create the State Service Application with PowerShell.Create State Service application with PowerShellRun the “SharePoint 2013 Management Shell” as Administrator.  Type: “New-SPStateServiceApplication”  Next enter the name for the service application “Name : State Service Application” With all the Service applications in place we will perform a IISReset make sure that all settings are refreshed.After the IISReset we can start the service by going to the following screen:Open “Central Administration”  Select “Application Management”  Then select “Manage services on server” With the Services screen open start the following services:App Management Service  Business Data Connectivity Service  Claims to Windows Token Service  Machine Translation Service  Managed Metadata Web Service  Request Management  Secure Store Service  User Profile Service  Work Management Service When these services are started we will make the farm account (svc_spfarm) local administrator. This is because off the same problem with SharePoint 2010.To make the svc_spfarm account local administrator do the following:Open Active Directory Users or Computer by doing the following:Go to the Start Menu by using the Windows button or by going to the low left corner with your mouse.  With the Start Menu open select “Active Directory Users and Computers”.  With Active Directory Users and Computers open open the domain and select the Builtin OU.  Within the Builtin OU find the administrators group and add the farm account to it. Perform a reset off your VM to reset the security of the farm account. Then go back the “Manage services on server” and start the “User Profile Synchronization Service”.When you will start this service you will have to connect it to a Service Application. Connect it to the User Profile Service application we created above.With all these service applications and web applications in place you have a great environment to start testing SharePoint 2013. If you have any further question just leave a comment and I will get back to you!!'>

<p>Last week we finished the installation of SharePoint 2013. For us to test the new version off SharePoint we still have to do some configuration.</p>
<p>The first thing we will do is creating a couple of service accounts that we will use to create Service Application and Web Applications.</p>
<p>Open Active Directory Users or Computer by doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the Start Menu by using the Windows button or by going to the low left corner with your mouse.  </li>
<li>With the Start Menu open select “Active Directory Users and Computers”. </li>
</ol>
<p>Open the Users OU and use your other mouse button to add a new user. When you have the “New Object - User” window open create the following user.</p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="517" border="0">

<p> </p>
<p>Make sure you select the options, for all of the accounts:</p>
<ul>
<li>User cannot change password.  </li>
<li>Password never expires. </li>
</ul>
<p>For us to create a new site we will also have to register a url within the DNS (You can also do this within your host file).  To alter the DNS configuration do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the Start Menu by using the Windows button or by going to the low left corner with your mouse.  </li>
<li>With the Start Menu open select “DNS”. </li>
</ol>
<p>Select the forward lookup zone of your domain and add a new A Host record. For this machine I chose the following domain: sp2013.dev.local.</p>

<p>For us to access this URL this machine we will also have to disable the LoopBackCheck, this is because Windows Server 2012 also had the same security enabled as Windows Server 2008 R2. To disable the LoopBackCheck check this blog post:</p>
<p><a title="http://msftplayground.com/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=52" href="/2009/04/access-denied-while-crawling-sites/">http://msftplayground.com/2009/04/access-denied-while-crawling-sites/</a></p>
<p>Now that we have done these configurations we can start with the last configuration steps off SharePoint. First off we will create some managed accounts:</p>
<p><strong>Create Managed Accounts</strong></p>
<p>To create managed accounts follow the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open “Central Administration”  </li>
<li>Go to the Security section.  </li>
<li>Select “Configure Managed Accounts”  under “General Security”.  </li>
<li>Then add managed accounts for all the accounts we created in the AD besides the spcontentaccess account. </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Create Secure Store Service</strong></p>
<p>We will also create a Secure Store Service for when we would like to test connections to other systems like CRM.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to create the application:</p>
<ol>
<li>With “Central Administration” opened go to the “Application Management” section.  </li>
<li>Select “Manage Service Applications”.  </li>
<li>On the toolbar select "New" and select “Secure Store Service Application"  </li>
<li>Create the Application with the following settings. </li>
</ol>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="402" border="0">

<td valign="top" width="200">Enable the audit log and set the days until purge to 30.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Create Work Management Service</strong></p>
<p>The work management service is the last service application we will create trough the UI. This is also one off the new service applications. The work management service application will give users the ability to edit and change there tasks on one single place within the SharePoint farm. This service will take care of changing values on other places and aggregating the tasks. One off the great things it is also possible to synchronize exchange tasks!!!</p>
<p>To create the Work Management Service follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>With “Central Administration” opened go to the “Application Management” section.  </li>
<li>Select “Manage Service Applications”.  </li>
<li>On the toolbar select "New" and select “Work management Service Application"  </li>
<li>Create the Application with the following settings. </li>
</ol>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="402" border="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200"><strong>Setting</strong></td>
<td valign="top" width="200"><strong>Value</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200">Name</td>
<td valign="top" width="200">Work Management Service Application</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200">Application Pool</td>
<td valign="top" width="200">Use existing application pool: <br><strong>Application pool name: <br></strong>SharePoint Service Application Pool</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200">Service Application Proxy</td>
<td valign="top" width="200">Select create proxy for this service application.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p> </p>
<p>This were all off the service application we will create trough the UI will will have to create the State Service Application with PowerShell.</p>
<p><strong>Create State Service application with PowerShell</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Run the “SharePoint 2013 Management Shell” as Administrator.  </li>
<li>Type: “New-SPStateServiceApplication”  </li>
<li>Next enter the name for the service application “Name : State Service Application” </li>
</ol>
<p>With all the Service applications in place we will perform a IISReset make sure that all settings are refreshed.</p>
<p>After the IISReset we can start the service by going to the following screen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open “Central Administration”  </li>
<li>Select “Application Management”  </li>
<li>Then select “Manage services on server” </li>
</ol>
<p>With the Services screen open start the following services:</p>
<ul>
<li>App Management Service  </li>
<li>Business Data Connectivity Service  </li>
<li>Claims to Windows Token Service  </li>
<li>Machine Translation Service  </li>
<li>Managed Metadata Web Service  </li>
<li>Request Management  </li>
<li>Secure Store Service  </li>
<li>User Profile Service  </li>
<li>Work Management Service </li>
</ul>
<p>When these services are started we will make the farm account (svc_spfarm) local administrator. This is because off the same problem with SharePoint 2010.</p>
<p>To make the svc_spfarm account local administrator do the following:</p>
<p>Open Active Directory Users or Computer by doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the Start Menu by using the Windows button or by going to the low left corner with your mouse.  </li>
<li>With the Start Menu open select “Active Directory Users and Computers”.  </li>
<li>With Active Directory Users and Computers open open the domain and select the Builtin OU.  </li>
<li>Within the Builtin OU find the administrators group and add the farm account to it. </li>
</ol>
<p>Perform a reset off your VM to reset the security of the farm account. Then go back the “Manage services on server” and start the “User Profile Synchronization Service”.</p>
<p>When you will start this service you will have to connect it to a Service Application. Connect it to the User Profile Service application we created above.</p>
<p>With all these service applications and web applications in place you have a great environment to start testing SharePoint 2013. If you have any further question just leave a comment and I will get back to you!!</p>
