<meta name="description" content="I love attending conferences that contain great content and especially when this content is presented by Program Managers or Evangelists from Microsoft. During the last years I have attended a few conferences. The best conferences I attended was TechEd 2014 in Barcelona. Last year I also attended Build in San Francisco, from which I came back a little disappointed especially the venue disappointed me. Seattle This year Build is held in Seattle, moving to Seattle made me decide to attend Build for the second time. “Build is an annual conference event held by Microsoft, aimed towards software and web developers using Windows, Windows Phone, Microsoft Azure and other Microsoft technologies. First held in 2011, it serves as a successor for Microsoft&#39;s previous developer events, the Professional Developers Conference (an infrequent event which covered development of software for the Windows operating system) and MIX (which covered web development centering on Microsoft technology such as Silverlight and ASP.net).” Registering for Build was a lot easier that last year. Last year we were placed on the waiting list and needed to wait for a month if we could join Build. This year Build will kick off on May 10. I will be traveling to Seattle on May 6th and will enjoy some free time in Seattle. I&#39;m very exited and I&#39;m expecting a lot off great content. On this blog and on twitter I will keep you posted on announcements (#MSBuild). If you’re at Build and you follow me, be sure to send me a message or tweet and we’ll meet up! Microsoft (Live) “Software continues to transform the world in remarkable ways and developers are at the center of it. At Microsoft Build 2017 we invite you to join us in downtown Seattle to learn about latest new technologies and exciting plans on the horizon. As always, Microsoft Build is filled with strong technical sessions as well as opportunities to meet and learn from others in the industry. We’ll make sure the schedule is filled with solid content, and will strive to deliver some fun surprises along the way. Not able to attend Microsoft Build? Keynotes and select sessions will be streamed live here!”">
