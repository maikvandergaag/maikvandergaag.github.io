<meta name="description" content="When I was reading and searching information about SharePoint 2010 on the internet I found I really helpful page in the Microsoft download&nbsp; to get started with development for SharePoint 2010. On the page a 10 Hands on Labs for you to try out in C# and Visual Basic. Overview HOL01 - Developing a Visual Web Part in Visual Studio 2010 This hands-on lab introduces the Visual Studio 2010 SharePoint development environment. It shows how to build a Visual Web Part using LINQ to SharePoint, and how to connect one Web Part to another Web Part on the page.  HOL02 - Developing a List Definition and Event Receiver in Visual Studio 2010 This hands-on lab walks you through building a list definition for SharePoint 2010 in Visual Studio 2010. It also shows how to build an event receiver for the list in Visual Studio 2010 and deploy it to SharePoint. After the list and event receiver are deployed, you can use the developer dashboard to evaluate the performance of the event receiver.  HOL03 - Developing Advanced Web Parts for SharePoint 2010 with Visual Studio 2010 This hands-on lab shows how to build a Web Part using several SharePoint-specific controls in Visual Studio 2010. Investigate advanced built-in Web Parts, including the Data View Web Part.  HOL04 - Developing with LINQ to SharePoint in Visual Studio 2010 This hands-on lab explores a variety of LINQ queries on SharePoint 2010, going into more depth than the introductory hands-on lab. It also walks you through an exercise of creating a custom content type in Visual Studio 2010.  HOL05 - Developing for SharePoint 2010 with the Client OM and REST in Visual Studio 2010 This hands-on lab introduces the Client object model for use in calling SharePoint 2010 APIs from a client machine. It also shows the use of ADO.NET Data Services to call REST services in SharePoint 2010.  HOL06 - Developing a BCS External Content Type with Visual Studio 2010 This hands-on lab walks you through building an external content type for Business Connectivity Services using Visual Studio 2010. It also builds a form for Microsoft Outlook and shows the data being edited offline in Outlook.  HOL07 - Developing a SharePoint 2010 Workflow with Initiation Form in Visual Studio 2010 This hands-on lab walks you through building a workflow in Visual Studio 2010 for SharePoint 2010. You add an initiation form to the workflow and use an external data exchange activity in the workflow.  HOL08 - Developing SharePoint 2010 User Interface with Silverlight in Visual Studio 2010 This hands-on lab walks you through building Microsoft Silverlight applications for use in SharePoint 2010. You will access SharePoint 2010 data in Silverlight using the Client object model.  HOL09 - Developing SharePoint 2010 Sandboxed Solutions in Visual Studio 2010 This hands-on lab walks you through building a Sandboxed Solution Web Part for SharePoint 2010. It will also add code to the Web Part that overloads the limits placed by the sandboxed solution, and you will review how the solution is shut down.  HOL10 - Developing SharePoint 2010 User Interface Ribbon and Dialog Customizations This hands-on lab walks you through adding a custom action to the SharePoint 2010 ribbon, and creating a Web Part that uses the Dialog Framework. You can download them here. Besides that I subscribed myself for one of the MSDN Get Ready sessions that will be given in November and December of this year. I will be attending the SharePoint 2010 Development session. Let me know if you will be attending one of those sessions.">
