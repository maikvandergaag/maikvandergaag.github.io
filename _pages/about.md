Microsoft Playground is a blog that I created in 2011. Before 2011 Maik had several other blogs.

Maik van der Gaag is the CTO of 3fifty, an experienced consultancy company with a strong focus on the Microsoft Cloud. He has over 15 years of experience providing architecture, development, training, and design expertise. During his work, he works on a variety of projects ranging from Cloud Transformations to DevOps implementations.

He loves to share his knowledge which was also one of the reasons why he founded the Dutch Cloud Meetup. Maik is a public speaker, who writes blogs, and organizes events. Microsoft has recognized him as Microsoft Azure MVP.
