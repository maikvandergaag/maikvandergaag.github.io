ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Maik van der Gaag â€“ a technology leader, community builder, and passionate advocate for the Microsoft Cloud.

Iâ€™m currently the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at [3fifty](https://3fifty.eu) which is part of the [Databalance](https://databalance.eu) group, where I help organizations succeed with modern cloud adoption and digital transformation. With more than 20 years of experience in architecture, software development, and DevOps, I specialize in bridging strategy with hands-on technology.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve been fortunate to work on a wide range of projects, from designing secure and scalable Azure environments to implementing Infrastructure as Code with Bicep and advancing DevOps practices.

## Community & Recognition

* Microsoft Azure MVP â€“ recognized for my ongoing contributions to the global tech community.
* Founder of Dutch Cloud Meetup â€“ creating a space for cloud professionals to connect and share knowledge. Which was a compelling community group in the Netherlands that retired in 2024.
* Community Leader at the [Azure Heroes](https://www.azug.nl/) community - A vibrant space for Azure enthusiasts to connect, share knowledge, and grow together!
* Public Speaker & Trainer â€“ I regularly speak at international events, conferences, and user groups on various topics.

## Sharing Knowledge

I believe knowledge should be shared, not kept. Thatâ€™s why I founded Microsoft Playground in 2011 â€“ a blog dedicated to Azure, DevOps, architecture, and hands-on guidance. I also contribute to open-source projects and publish reusable modules and extensions to help others build more effectively in the cloud.
