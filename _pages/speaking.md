I'm a frequent speaker at international conferences, community events, and meetups, where I share insights and practical experiences around Azure, DevOps, Infrastructure as Code, security, and cloud governance. Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of presenting sessions that range from deep-dive technical demos to strategic talks that help organizations get the most out of their cloud investments.

You can explore the full overview of my sessions, past engagements, and upcoming talks on my [Sessionize](https://sessionize.com/maikvandergaag/) profile.

If you’re interested in having me speak at your event—whether it's a conference, webinar, meetup, or in-company knowledge session—feel free to connect with me and reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maikvandergaag/) or [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/maikvandergaag.online). I'm always open to collaborating with communities and organizations that share the passion for learning, innovation, and building with the Microsoft Cloud.
