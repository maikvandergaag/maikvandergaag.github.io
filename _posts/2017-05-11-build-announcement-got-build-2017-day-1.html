<p>DevOps was one of the buzz words of Build 2017. At the keynote every attendee got a folder regarding the DevOps sessions.

<h2>Asp.Net Core 2.0</h2>
<p>The Asp.Net Core 2.0 sessions was a really good and funny session from Scott Hanselman and Daniel Roth about the announced preview of Asp.Net Core 2.0. Within this session they showed the new capabilities and possibilities of .Net Core 2.0. Executable can be downloaded from the following place:</p>
<p><a title="https://www.microsoft.com/net/core/preview#windowscmd" href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/core/preview#windowscmd">https://www.microsoft.com/net/core/preview#windowscmd</a></p>

<p>Besides the above announcement Microsoft is also focusing on Container DevOps and announced a lot of things as you can see in the below picture.</p>
<p><a href="https://msftplayground.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/image-4.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Container DevOps with VSTS" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/archive/2017/05/image_thumb-4.png" alt="Container DevOps with VSTS" width="846" height="483" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Another great announcement that will be coming soon was Pipeline as Code this basically is a definition file of your release pipeline based on YALM.</p>
<h2>Azure Compute: New Features and roadmap</h2>
<p>During this session new features and roadmap information was given about everything about Azure Compute divided into three sections: Infrastructure, Containers and Platform, were mainly two of them were very important to my opinion.</p>
<h3>Infrastructure</h3>
<p>A lot of new IaaS sizes were announced were two of them were special. The Dv3 en Ev3 were discussed and shown especially because they support nested virtualization. Nested virtualization is the virtualization of machines within a virtual machines. Besides that Corey Sanders gave a demonstration of Azure PowerShell within the Azure Portal that is coming soon and is in preview. The best feature of Azure PowerShell within the Azure Portal was the ability to browse your Azure subscriptions and resources in a file based format using the “dir” and “cd” commands. If your would like to sign up for the preview go to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://aka.ms/PsCloudSignUp">https://aka.ms/PsCloudSignUp</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Another announcement was a new service called: “Instance Metadata Service” that runs on the virtual machines within Azure that is a rest Api on: https://169.254.169.254 and shows information of the machine for example maintenance windows and scheduled reboots.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>An announcement for platform was about Azure batch called Low Priority Batch VMs which are evitable instances which will give you to 80% discount. It really means that Microsoft can get back instances of that you define as Low Priority Batch VMs in order to use for other type of usage that will result in a large discount for you.</p>
<p>The preview of the Azure Function Runtime was also an announcement that makes it possible to run the Azure Function runtime almost everywhere like within Azure IoT Edge. You can download it from here: https://aka.ms/azafr</p>
<p>Last but not least they announced a feature that Seals azure services as a sealed app in other to distribute  them and keep management over the applications that is called Azure Managed Applications (should be available today).</p>
