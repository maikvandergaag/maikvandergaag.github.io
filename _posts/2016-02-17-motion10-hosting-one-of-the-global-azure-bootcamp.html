<p><strong>What is Global Azure Bootcamp 2016?  </strong><br />
Building on the exceptional success of previous years, Global Azure Bootcamp 2016 (#GlobalAzure) is a free one-day training event, taking place on the 16th of April 2016 in several venues worldwide, driven by local Microsoft Azure community enthusiasts and experts. It consists of a day of sessions and labs based on the Microsoft Azure Readiness Kit or custom content. The event has been originally designed by 5 Microsoft Azure MVPs in order to benefit the local community members and teach essential Microsoft Azure skills and know-how. While supported by several sponsors, including Microsoft, the event is completely independent and community-driven.</p>
