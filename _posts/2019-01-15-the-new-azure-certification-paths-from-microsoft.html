<p>Recently, Microsoft released new certifications and the corresponding learning paths. These certifications are more focused on job profiles. Microsoft also calls this "rolebased learning". </p>


<p>This is the biggest reason why Microsoft has created these paths. The old existing certifications for Microsoft Azure (70-532, 70-533, 70-535) are very broad in scope and cover a wide range of skills that most professionals can not master.</p>


<p>What do these new certification paths mean? In this article I will try to make this clear to you.</p>


<h2>New certification paths</h2>


<p>As described above, the new certification paths better reflect the day-to-day activities of professionals. This can also be seen in the names of the certifications:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="#header-fundamentals">Microsoft Certified Azure Fundamentals</a></li>
<li><a href="#header-administrator">Microsoft Certified Azure Administrator</a></li>
<li><a href="#header-developer">Microsoft Certified Azure Developer</a></li>
<li><a href="#header-architect">Microsoft Certified Azure Solutions Architect</a></li>
<li><a href="#header-devops">Microsoft Certified Azure DevOps Engineer</a></li>
</ul>

</ul>


<h3>For who is it?</h3>


<p>This certification is intended for candidates who want to demonstrate basic knowledge of cloud services and how these services work in Azure. This exam is therefore intended for people with non-technical backgrounds such as those involved in the sales or purchase of cloud-based solutions. By obtaining this certification, they demonstrate that they have basic knowledge of Azure and that they master the following concepts within the Azure cloud:</p>


<ul>
<li>Understand cloud concepts</li>
<li>Knowledge of Azure core services</li>

<li>Azure costs and support</li>

</ul>


<p>If you have already passed the 70-533 exam you will be able to pass the following exam (until June 30):</p>


<ul>
<li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-az-102.aspx" target="_blank">AZ-102 Microsoft Azure Administrator Certification Transition</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This certification path does not have a transition exam like the "Microsoft Certified Azure Administrator" path for the simple reason that only one exam is needed. During the development of this path, there were two exams for a long time (AZ-200 and AZ-201), but feedback from the people who took the exams led to the merging of the certifications into one overarching certificate.</p>


<h3 id="mce_57">For who is it?</h3>


<p>his certification path is intended for developers who develop cloud solutions such as applications and services. With this certification they show that they have the following knowledge.</p>

</ul>


<p>As with the Microsoft Certified Azure Administrator certification, both exams must be passed for the Microsoft Certified Azure Solutions Architect predicate.</p>


<p>If you have already passed the 'old' 70-535 exam, an upgrade path is available:</p>


<ul>
