<p>The Office engineering team signed off on a new Build. The build they signed off for is RTM. This means SharePoint 2013 will be able to be downloaded in less than a month from now on TechNet or MSDN.</p>

<p>You can read all about it on the Office News site: <a title="http://blogs.office.com/b/office-news/archive/2012/10/11/office-reaches-rtm.aspx" href="http://blogs.office.com/b/office-news/archive/2012/10/11/office-reaches-rtm.aspx">http://blogs.office.com/b/office-news/archive/2012/10/11/office-reaches-rtm.aspx</a></p>
<p>Some interesting point from the news article are:</p>
<p><em>Additionally, we have a number of programs that provide business customers with early access so they can begin testing, piloting and adopting Office within their organizations: </em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>We will begin rolling out new capabilities to Office 365 Enterprise customers in our next service update, starting in November through general availability. </em> </li>
<li><em>Volume Licensing customers with Software Assurance will be able to download the Office 2013 applications as well as other Office products including SharePoint 2013, Lync 2013 and Exchange 2013 through the Volume Licensing Service Center by mid-November. These products will be available on the Volume Licensing price list on December 1. </em> </li>
<li><em>IT professionals and developers will be able to download the final version via their TechNet or MSDN subscriptions by mid-November. </em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Please stay tuned for more specifics on general availability dates and other Office launch news. In the meantime, if you'd like to give the pre-release version a try, you can visit </em><em>office.com/preview</em><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you to the millions of people who have been testing early releases of the new Office. We are grateful for your support. Your invaluable feedback has helped us make the new Office the best Office ever.</em></p>
