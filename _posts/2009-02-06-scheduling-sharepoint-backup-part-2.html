<div class="ExternalClass73FC825636C64EF596B832A67662238B">A while ago I posted a <a href="/2008/12/scheduling-sharepoint-backup/">SharePoint Backup script</a> so that it is possible to schedule a SharePoint Backup. I had to make some adjustments to the script because it contains small errors. The adjustments I had to make were:
<ul>
<li>When you perform multiple differential backups in a week you will receive multiple e-mails for one backup.  </li>
<li>I have created more properties so that you can alter the script from the top.  </li>
<li>You do not have to delete a method when you choose the differential backup method  </li>
<li>I cleaned the script up a little bit.</li>
</ul>
