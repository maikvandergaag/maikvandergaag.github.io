<p>In the last couple of projects I have been at we had a lot of integration question and development request to integrate several objects from CRM. Not In all project I think the right solution was chosen because one of my colleagues pointed me to the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=82e632a7-faf9-41e0-8ec1-a2662aae9dfb&amp;displaylang=en">CRM 4.0 SDK</a>.</p>
<p>With this SDK you do not have to add a service reference to visual studio to talk to CRM but you can open the CRM context by using a connection string:</p>
<pre class="highlight">&lt;connectionStrings&gt;
  &lt;add name="Crm" connectionString="Authentication Type=Passport;
    Server=https://your-org-name.crm.dynamics.com/your-orgid;
    User ID=your-windowslive-id; Password=your-wlid-password;
    Device ID=your-device-id; Device Password=your-device-password"/&gt;
&lt;/connectionStrings&gt;</pre>
<p>And opening the datacontext with that connection string for example with:</p>
<pre class="highlight">var crm = new Xrm.XrmDataContext("CRMOnline");</pre>
<p>The SDK really makes it simple and easy to integration CRM with SharePoint or other .Net based web application.</p>
<p>So if you want to integrate CRM with another application you really should take a look at the:</p>
