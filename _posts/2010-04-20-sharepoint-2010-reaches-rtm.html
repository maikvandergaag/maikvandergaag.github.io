<p>16 April Microsoft reached an exciting engineering milestone: the release-to-manufacturing (RTM) for Office 2010, SharePoint 2010, Visio 2010 and Project 2010!</p>
<p>The Volume License customers with active Software Assurance (SA) on these products will be one of the first to receive the 2010 set of products. They will be able to download the product in English, French, Spanish, German, Russian, and Dutch via the Volume Licensing Service Center starting April 27.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is said that MSDN and Technet subscribers can download the version on April 22.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Canâ€™t wait to get my hands on the release.</p>
