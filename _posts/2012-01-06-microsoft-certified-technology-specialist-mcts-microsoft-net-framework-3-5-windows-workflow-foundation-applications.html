<div class="ExternalClass632BA16BF34E4156AD5FC7CAE7B913FA">
<p>18 months ago I decided to become Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist (MCTS): Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5, Windows Workflow Foundation Applications. I bought a book (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Windows-Workflow-Foundation-Step/dp/073562335X/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325863947&amp;sr=8-4">Windows Workflow Foundation Step by Step</a>) and started reading. After reading about 150 pages I was to busy to continue reading.</p>
<p>Three months ago I started reading the book again and I finally finished it just before the end of 2011.</p>
<p>Today I had my exam to my surprise I had to answer 70 questions were my past exams had only 50 questions. It was a really tough exam. I needed 140 minutes to finish the exam.</p>
<p>But I passed the exam this is really one to be proud off! If you want to try this exam I really recommend you (when you read the some book) to look at the differences between WWF 3.0 and 3.5. Beside that I also recommend you to take this training (6462A: Visual Studio 2008: Windows Workflow Foundation (2 Days)) which one I did not attend.</p>
