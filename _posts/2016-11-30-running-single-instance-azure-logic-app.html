<p>In certain scenarios you want to run a Single Instance off a Azure Logic App every time. Scenarios were you need this is when containers are created within your flow and the other messages are also depending on the same containers.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Together with a colleague of mine we searched for a solution and finally found the answer after having contact with Microsoft. The trigger component within a Logic App has a property called “operationOptions”. This property can be set to “SingleInstance” this will make sure the Logic App will only be trigged per message.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<pre class="highlight">"triggers": {
  "When_a_message_is_received_in_a_topic_subscription": {
    "type": "ApiConnection",
    "inputs": {
      "host": {
        "api": {
          "runtimeUrl": "https://logic-apis-westeurope.azure-apim.net/apim/servicebus"
        },
        "connection": {
          "name": "[name]"
        }
      },
      "method": "get",
      "path": "[path]"
    },
    "operationOptions": "SingleInstance",
    "recurrence": {
      "interval": 1,
      "frequency": "Minute"
    }
  }
}
</pre>
<p>The code snip-it above is a Service Bus trigger for new messages within a topic. By adding the “operationsOptions” this Logic App will only be triggered once per message.</p>
<h2>Disadvantage</h2>
<p>When using the “operationsOptions” property you have to keep in mind that only one instance will run within your interval. For example when there are 5 messages within the topic, and the Logic App is triggered once every minute it will get one message from the topic every minute and will not run a new flow if the preceding message is processed. In this example it will take about 5 minutes to process the 5 messages depending on how long your Logic Apps runs.</p>
