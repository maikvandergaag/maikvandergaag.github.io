<p>About a year ago I wrote a article on how to create a custom list view by using the JS link property. This turned out to be a great article and was very much appreciated by the readers of my blog.&nbsp; Webucator a company that gives instructor led training contacted me a month ago if they could make a small video on the subject.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was honored by the request and they made the video which is really awesome. Take a look at the video in this blog post and you could also take a look at the training services webucator has to offer.</p>
