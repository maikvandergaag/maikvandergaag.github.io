<p>Visual Studio Team Services is the formally know Visual Studio Online. The old name brought a lot of confusion I think the new name will do a lot better.</p>
<p>Yesterday they announced the Public Preview of Release Management in VSTS named Release Management Service. This service will help you automate deployment to multiple environments.</p>
<p>If you have ever worked with the On-Premise version you will know that it is easy to setup and it gives you the option to visualize and track the progress of your deployment.</p>
