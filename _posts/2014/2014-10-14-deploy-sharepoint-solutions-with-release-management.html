<p>In one of my previous post (<a href="http://msftplayground.com/2014/09/configuring-web-site-binding-with-release-management/">Configuring Web Site Binding with Release Management</a>) I showed how you can make a custom action for Release Management to configure web bindings.</p>
<p>As described in that post Release Management is a tool that provides a continuous deployment solution that makes release cycles repeatable, visible, and more efficient by automating deployments through every environment from test to production.</p>
<p>When you want to make use of Release Management in a scenario were you will deploy your SharePoint solutions within your DTAP environment you have to make some custom actions / components in order to facilitate this functionality.</p>
<p>In a upcoming series of posts I will work you trough the process of making and adjusting the TFS Build template in order to build your SharePoint solutions and how to make a custom PowerShell component for Release Management to deploy your SharePoint solutions.</p>

<p>In this series of posts I assume that you have setup your build server in order to build SharePoint solutions. If not read this article on MSDN:</p>

<p>The individual parts will be written down in the upcoming weeks. I will try to write a Part a week but I also have to attend to the TechEd in Barcelona so I don’t know If I will be able to write down a post in that week.</p>
