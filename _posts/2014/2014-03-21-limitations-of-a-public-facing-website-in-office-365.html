<p><strong>Update :</strong>Microsoft is stopping with public facing websites for new Office 365 clients, existing ones will have another 2 year support. <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-confirms-it-is-dropping-public-website-feature-from-sharepoint-online/">http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-confirms-it-is-dropping-public-website-feature-from-sharepoint-online/</a></p>
<p>When you buy an Office 365 tenant you get the option to build a Public website within the SharePoint administration panel.</p>
<p>Creating a website will give you the following URL by default:</p>
<ul>
<li>http://[tenant]-public.sharepoint.com.</li>
</ul>
<p>Within SharePoint 2013 they have extended the options to build massive websites where you had to do a lot of customizations in SharePoint 2010. There are already many site available for example (http://www.motion10.nl ) but most off these websites are build on SharePoint 2013 on premise. This is all because building a public website within Office 365 has a lot of limitations. In this blog post I will try to list the limitations I know. If you find any other limitations or they have changed something on the Office 365 platform to make it work and I haven’t alter the blog post please add a comment or send me a email.</p>
<p><strong>Site Settings</strong></p>
<p>Multiple site settings screens are missing from the administration menu. Some of these pages can be accessed by the Url and some of them don’t even exist.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Manage Site Collection Features: </strong>The link and the page are missing for a public website.</li>
<li><strong>Manage Site Features</strong>: The link and the page are missing for a public website.</li>
<li><strong>Site Content Types</strong>: The link and the page are missing for a public website.</li>
<li><strong>Site Columns</strong>: The links is missing for a public website you can access the page by using the following URL: [URL]/_layouts/15/mngfield.aspx.</li>
<li><strong>Solution Gallery</strong>: The links is missing for a public website you can access the page by using the following URL: [URL]/_catalogs/solutions/Forms/AllItems.aspx.</li>
<li><strong>Web Part Gallery</strong>: The links is missing for a public website you can access the page by using the following URL: [URL]/_catalogs/wp/Forms/AllItems.aspx.</li>

<li><strong>Term store management</strong>: The link and the page are missing for a public website.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you would like to activate or see which features are activated on the SharePoint Public site take a look at this blog post:</p>

<p><strong>Variations</strong></p>
<p>Many website on the internet are created in multiple languages. Looking at SharePoint you would then maybe would like to use <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff628966(v=office.15).aspx">Variations</a>. In Office 365 variations cannot be used.</p>
<p><strong>Managed Metadata</strong></p>
<p>As you can see on point 8 within the site settings section you are not able to access the Term Store Management. This also makes it that one off the amazing new features off SharePoint 2013 <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj163978.aspx">taxonomy-based navigation</a> cannot be used on a Office 365 public website.</p>
<p>Besides that more taxonomy based features do not work as for example the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj656774(v=office.15).aspx">product catalog</a> functionality.</p>
<p><strong>Sub Sites</strong></p>
<p>From the UI you cannot create a sub site.  You will have to use SharePoint Designer in order to create a sub site. But even then you are not able to use every site template. In my situation I tried to create a Publishing Site and it got immediately deleted from my tenant.</p>
<p>The only templates that can be used on the online version are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Team Site</li>
<li>Basic Search Site</li>
<li><strong>Content Search Web Part:</strong>One of the web parts you had to develop for previous version of SharePoint (At least I did) now came to SharePoint 2013 and that is the “<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj163789.aspx">Content Search Web Part</a>”. This web part is not available on the public web site of Office 365.</li>
</ul>
<p>Online you can find great tips to deal with the limitations of the Public website:</p>
