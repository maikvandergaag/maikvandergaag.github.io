<p>A few weeks ago I was looking at ways how I could test my ARM<br />
templates. During my work I create a lot of these templates and it always a lot<br />
of work to check them and comply with the best practices. Especially when we<br />
work in teams and everybody has his own way of creating the templates.</p>


<p>After some research I found a blog <a href="https://dev.to/omiossec/arm-template-what-s-new-for-2020-4kli" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">post</a> of: Olivier Miossec (a Microsoft Azure MVP). He was mentioning a tool called “ARM-TTK” which is being developed by Microsoft and is still in preview.</p>


<p>Reading this made me test the tool out.</p>


<h2>ARM-TTK</h2>


<p>ARM-TTK is written as a PowerShell Module that can be run in<br />
Windows or Linux. When using Linux PowerShell Core needs to be installed.</p>


<p>The module is still in preview but Microsoft is actively<br />
developing it on GitHub. Using this option everyone is allowed to test it and use<br />
it in there on scenario’s.</p>


<p>To test it download the folder from the GitHub repository:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/test/arm-ttk">https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/test/arm-ttk</a></li>
</ul>


<p>As you may know with the downloaded folder you can Import the module. As there is no online location yet you have to reference the file name.</p>


<pre class="highlight">Import-Module '[Path to the Module]'</pre>


<h2>Executing ARM-TTK</h2>


<p>With the module loaded in our PowerShell session it is time to execute some test against some of the ARM templates I have. To run a test run the following command:</p>


<pre class="highlight"> Test-AzTemplate 'D:\temp\azuredeploy.json'</pre>


<p>Running this command will give a result like the image below.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/assets/archive/2020/01/2020-01-06_13-37-19.png" alt="ARM-TTK" class="wp-image-5917" /></figure>


<p>The tool uses a testing framework called Pester to test<br />
certain scenario’s against the ARM template. Besides that the tool doesn’t use<br />
the Azure context at this moment making it a very quick test framework with a<br />
lot of great result. Some of the things it checks are:</p>


<ul>
<li>JSON validation</li>
<li><strong>apiVersions<br />
Should Be Recent</strong>: It will also show recent version you can use.</li>
<li><strong>artifacts<br />
parameter</strong>: It checks the artifact parameters and whether they are used within<br />
the template.</li>
<li>Outputs Must Not Contain Secrets</li>
<li>Parameters Property Must Exist</li>
<li>Virtual Machines Should Not Be Preview</li>
</ul>


<p>All together this looks like a really great tool that can be<br />
extended very quickly and is really useful. Next step is creating this<br />
extension within a Azure DevOps Pipeline task in order to use it CI and CD<br />
scenario’s.</p>
