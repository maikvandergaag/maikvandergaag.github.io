<p>In order to retrieve information from Azure Subscriptions someone at a client wanted to use the Resource Graph API. For this they were building an ASP.Net Core application and where using the C# SDK. The problem that they were having was related to the authentication. </p>


<h2>Azure Resource Graph</h2>


<p>The resource graph is a service in Azure that is designed to extend Azure Resource Management by providing efficient and performant resource exploration with the ability to query at scale across a given set of subscriptions so that you can effectively govern your environment.</p>


<p>For this you make use of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kusto/query/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004255" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" label="kusto  (opens in a new tab)">kusto </a>queries that you send to the API.</p>


<p>More information about the Azure Resource Graph: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/resource-graph/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004255" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" label=" (opens in a new tab)">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/resource-graph/overview</a></p>


<h2>Implementation</h2>


<p>To connect to the Resource Graph an authentication object needs to exist. We wanted to use a service principal. The process using this code is a background job and did not have any user interaction.</p>


<p>To use the Resource Graph within a C# application add the following NuGet packages: </p>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Management.ResourceGraph/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Microsoft.Azure.Management.ResourceGraph</a>: SDK for C# applications. </li>
<li> <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Services.AppAuthentication/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Microsoft.Azure.Services.AppAuthentication</a>: Package for handling the authentication.</li>
</ul>


<p>The resource graph NuGet package contains the “ResourceGraphClient” that is needed to perform queries against the resource graph API. </p>


<p>To be able to initiate a “ResourceGraphClient” it requires an object called “ServiceClientCredentials”. The "ServiceClientCredentials" object is a base class for the "TokenCredentials" object that we can construct for the service principal.</p>


<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> The demo code is a simple setup.</em> W<em>hen using this in production y</em>ou should save secure value in <em>a vault and configuration values in a config file.</em></p>
</blockquote>


<p>First off, we create a helper class with a method that will retrieve the "ServiceClientCredentials" object.</p>


<pre class="highlight">using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory;
using Microsoft.Rest;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace GraphClient
{
    public static class AuthenticationHelper
    {
        public static async Task&lt;ServiceClientCredentials> GetServiceClientCredentials(string resource, string clientId, string clientSecret, string authority)
        {
            AuthenticationContext authContext = new AuthenticationContext(authority);

            AuthenticationResult authResult = await authContext.AcquireTokenAsync(resource, new ClientCredential(clientId, clientSecret));

            string accessToken = authResult.AccessToken;

            ServiceClientCredentials serviceClientCreds = new TokenCredentials(authResult.AccessToken);

            return serviceClientCreds;
        }
    }
}</pre>


<p>The class contains a method to retrieve the required object. This is done by specifying the authentication context (the Azure AD tenant) and retrieving a token by specifying the resource "https://management.core.windows.net" (default for the resource graph API), the client id and client secret. With the token we can initiate the "TokenCredentials" object that derives from the "ServiceClientCredentials" class.</p>


<p>With this class and method in place we will develop the other peace needed to perform the queries. </p>


<pre class="highlight">using Microsoft.Azure.Management.ResourceGraph;
using Microsoft.Azure.Management.ResourceGraph.Models;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace GraphClient
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string clientId = "[clientid]";
            string clientSecret = "[clientSecret]";
            string tenantId = "[tenantId]";
            string subscriptionId = "[subscriptionId]";
            string query = "Resources | project name, type | limit 5";
            string authority = $"https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantId}";

            ResourceGraphClient client = new ResourceGraphClient(AuthenticationHelper.GetServiceClientCredentials("https://management.core.windows.net", clientId, clientSecret, authority).Result);

            var response = client.Resources(new QueryRequest(new List&lt;string>(){ subscriptionId }, query));

            Console.WriteLine(response);
        }
    }
}</pre>


<p>This part of the code initiates the "ResourceClient" class that will execute a Kusto query via the "Resources" mehod.</p>
