<p id="tw-target-text">Control over your cloud environment is great. In order to properly monitor and manage a cloud environment, it is important to draw up a cloud governance plan based on the company policy. </p>


<p id="tw-target-text">In this plan, you name all aspects that are essential and then implement the policy. But what steps do you need to take to draw up a good cloud governance plan?</p>


<p id="tw-target-text">For every organization it is important to keep control on the cloud environment. This is not only related to; who has rights where, it is also about making the costs transparent. If these costs are transparent, it is easy to make a so-called IT charge or showback of these costs. </p>


<p id="tw-target-text">IT chargeback and IT showback are two policies used by IT departments to inform and / or bill the costs for the use of each department of division. Read more about <a href="https://www.bmc.com/blogs/chargeback-vs-showback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IT charge and showback here</a>. </p>


<p id="tw-target-text">To get control over the cloud platform one of the first steps is write a cloud governance plan.</p>


<h2>Cloud Governance</h2>


<p id="tw-target-text">From the company policy the Cloud governance is formalized For this document, the following aspects are mainly considered: </p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Business risks</strong>: Identifying and understanding business risks. </li>
<li><strong>Policy and compliance</strong>: Convert risk into statements that support any compliance requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Processes</strong>: Ensuring compliance with the established policy. </li>
</ul>




<p>You then write up five disciplines based on this policy, which are:</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Cost management</strong>: Evaluate and monitor costs, keep IT expenses under control and gain insight into costs. </li>
<li><strong>Basic security</strong>: Ensure compliance with IT security requirements by applying a basic security line. </li>
<li><strong>Resource consistency</strong>: Provide consistency in resource configuration. </li>
<li><strong>Basic Identity Configuration</strong>: Ensure that the basis for identity and access is maintained by applying consistent role definitions and assignments.</li>
<li><strong>Deployment acceleration</strong>: Accelerate deployment through centralization, consistency, and standardization across resource templates.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Governance Implementation</h2>


<p id="tw-target-text">After setting up the cloud governance, it is time for implementation. With the implementation you ensure that the established policy can be complied with and checked.</p>


<p id="tw-target-text">By applying cloud governance you ensure a cloud platform that is in the best possible status and that the platform is compliant. Within Azure there are various services that support you in setting up cloud governance. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004255" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Check out this website</a> for more information on Azure Governance.</p>


<h2>Management groups</h2>


<p id="tw-target-text">Management groups are virtual containers in which subscriptions are placed. By means of these containers the subscriptions can be placed in a hierarchy. This makes it possible to manage subscriptions uniformly and manage policies and access rights across multiple subscriptions. </p>

<p id="tw-target-text">Some important points of Management groups are: </p>


<ul>
<li>A structure for Management groups is set up per Azure Active Directory; </li>
<li>By default, a Tenant Root Management group is present per tenant. </li>
</ul>


<p>Limits of Management groups are:</p>


<ul>
<li>One Azure Active Directory tenant can contain 10,000 management groups; </li>
<li>The structure can be made up to 6 levels deep (excluding the Tenant Root Management group.);</li>
<li>Groups or subscriptions can be placed in one group.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Azure Policies</h2>


<p id="tw-target-text">As described, policies have been written down for the cloud platform. These policies can be enforced or registered through Azure Policies. </p>


<p id="tw-target-text">Azure Policies specifies the rules in a JSON format, making the rules easy to check by the platform. The platform itself has a large number of rules build-in, some examples for this are: </p>


<ul>
<li>Require tag and its value on resource groups;</li>
<li>Allowed locations;</li>
<li>A maximum of 3 owners should be designated for your subscription;</li>
<li>MFA should be enabled on accounts with owner permissions on your subscription.</li>
</ul>


<p>The above rules are a small selection of the policies that can be used by default. Next to that you can also specify customer policies to be compliant with your governance design.</p>


<h2 id="tw-target-text">Other Azure Services</h2>


<p id="tw-target-text"> In addition to Azure Policies and management groups, there are a large number of other Azure Services and platform functionalities that support cloud governance:</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Azure Automation</strong>: Automating various cloud infrastructure tasks. </li>
<li><strong>Azure Monitor</strong>: Monitoring resources and supporting alerts for the cloud team. </li>
<li><strong>Azure Blueprints</strong>: A blueprint for new subscriptions related to role assignment, resources and policies.</li>
<li><strong>Role Based Access Control</strong>: Grant rights based on roles of employees and administrators.</li>
<li><strong>Privilege Identity Management</strong>: Being able to temporarily assign additional rights for management tasks.</li>
</ul>
