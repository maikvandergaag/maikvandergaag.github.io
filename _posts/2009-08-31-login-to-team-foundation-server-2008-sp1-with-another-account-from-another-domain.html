<div class="ExternalClass5C6708FEC90C44D48AC04691E25FE512">
<p>A few days ago I and my colleague Wesley had a lot of problems installing of Team Foundation Server on Windows Server 2008 with a Separate SQL Server 2008 and SharePoint Farm. After a couple days of hard work we finally got it running.</p>
<p>When we completed the installation we began testing it on our local systems. On our local system everything went fine but when we tried it on a Virtual Machine that we use for developing solution for SharePoint we could not connect to the Team Foundation Server. </p>
<p>The problem here was that the Virtual Machine has its own domain so the account that you are logged in with could not authenticate to the TFS server.</p>
<p>To get around this you have to specify a network account by following the following steps (Windows Server 2008):</p>
<p><strong>1:</strong> Start – Control Panel <br /><strong>2:</strong> In the Control Panel select User Accounts. <br /><strong>3:</strong> On the left side of the screen select Manage your network passwords.</p>
<p><a href="http://msftplayground.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/NetworkAccounts.png"><img title="NetworkAccounts" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="NetworkAccounts" src="/assets/archive/2009/08/NetworkAccounts_thumb.png" width="240" height="236" /></a></p>
<p><strong>4:</strong> Click add and insert the right information.</p>
<p><a href="http://msftplayground.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/networkcredentials.png"><img title="networkcredentials" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="networkcredentials" src="/assets/archive/2009/08/networkcredentials_thumb.png" width="205" height="240" /></a></p>
<p><strong>5:</strong> Click “Ok” when you are done and on the other screen select “close”</p>
<p>Try connecting to the Team Foundation Server again. Now everything should work perfectly.</p>
