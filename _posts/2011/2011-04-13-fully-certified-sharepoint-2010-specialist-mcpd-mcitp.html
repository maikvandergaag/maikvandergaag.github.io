<div class="ExternalClassA0E230D34E624C9BB73719B6DAE35FFE">
<p>â€‹It took me long enough to get all off the SharePoint certificates but Yesterday I finally passed the last exam.</p>
<p>I know have the following SharePoint 2010 certificates:</p>
<ul>
<li>70-573: MCTS: Microsoft SharePoint 2010, Application Development</li>
<li>70-667: MCTS: Microsoft SharePoint 2010, Configuring</li>
<li>70-668: PRO: Microsoft SharePoint 2010, Administrator</li>
<li>70-576: PRO: Designing and Developing Microsoft SharePoint 2010 Applications</li>
</ul>
<p>I have to say that 70-668 was the hardest exams of them all. But I think that everyone that has enough experience with SharePoint can pass these exams you just have to filter out the wrong answers.</p>
<p>For now I will take a few months of rest in which I will move to my new house in Vlaardingen and wait till the moment my lovely girlfriend will give birth to our son/daughter.</p>
<p>And then I will go for the .NET Framework 3.5 exams especially (.NET Framework 3.5, Windows Workflow Foundation Applications (70-504)).</p>
