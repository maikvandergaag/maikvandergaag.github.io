<div class="ExternalClass1F65229349394074BB28D9C939033BC8">
<p>Today I was replacing certain SharePoint documents for one of the projects we are working on. I noticed that the transfer of the document from Windows Explorer View to Windows Explorer view was very slow!! I mean 16,1 kb per Second slow!!!.</p>
<p>Investigating this problem I found that IE is configured to “Automatically detect settings”:</p>
<p><a href="http://msftplayground.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/LAN_Settings.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="LAN_Settings" src="/assets/archive/2011/09/LAN_Settings_thumb.png" alt="LAN_Settings" width="240" height="210" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>This was causing the WebDAV connection to work very slow. Disabling this obtain automatically made my transfer much faster. You can find this option by doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>In IE open the tools menu and click on Internet options.</li>
<li>Click on the connections tab.</li>
<li>Click on the Lan settings button.</li>
<li>Uncheck the Checkbox and press ‘Ok’ to save the settings.</li>
</ol>
