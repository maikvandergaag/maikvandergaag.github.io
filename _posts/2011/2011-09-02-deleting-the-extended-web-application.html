<div class="ExternalClass59FD7FB0383D4BA48E782CF05F275A94">
<p>This post Iâ€™m as a reminder because a few days back when I was working on a production environment for one of our clients. I had created an extended web application and needed to remove it. In SharePoint 2007 I have done this several times but in 2010 I had to take a good look.</p>
<p>To delete the extended web application you need to do the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
<li>Start <b>Central Administration.</b></li>
<li>Go to <b>Manage Web Applications.</b></li>
<li>Select the web application you extended.</li>
<li>Click on the Arrow beneath <strong>Delete</strong> and select <strong>Remove SharePoint from IIS Web Site.</strong></li>
<li>Select the Web site.</li>
<li>Finally click <b>OK</b></li>
</ol>
</div>
