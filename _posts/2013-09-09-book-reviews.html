<p>As a IT consultant you always have to renew your skills and start to learn new technologies. In the last couple of months I have been reading a couple off books in order to learn new stuff and get the new certificates there are.
<p>To help my fellow IT consultants I will try the option of writing book reviews to help others to select books for their certifications paths or just to learn new technologies.
<p>I hope everyone will enjoy my book reviews. Please let me know what you think of this new step.</p>
<p>You can read all of the book reviews here: http://msftplayground.com/book-review/ or you can select one off my latest ones at the right side.</p></p>
