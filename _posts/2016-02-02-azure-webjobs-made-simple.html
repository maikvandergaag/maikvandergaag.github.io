<p>The last couple of weeks I have been playing around with <a href="https://mix.office.com/" target="_blank">Office Mix</a>. For those who don’t know Office Mix, Office Mix is a add-in for PowerPoint that is in preview to easily create and share interactive online videos.</p>
<p>With this add-in it is very easy to create a Video of your presentations and also insert screen recordings. For a first pilot I created a PowerPoint presentation called: “Azure WebJobs made simple”.</p>
<p>With Azure WebJobs you have options to run different background tasks. The WebJobs will be hosted on the same virtual machine as you Azure Web App.</p>
<p>The following file types can be used as a Azure WebJob:</p>
<ul>
<li>.exe - .NET assemblies</li>
<li>.cmd, .bat, .exe (using windows cmd)</li>
<li>.sh (using bash)</li>
<li>.php (using php)</li>
<li>.py (using python)</li>
<li>.js (using node)</li>
</ul>
<p>For this blog post and for the video I created a simple Console Application that executes the following code.</p>
<pre class="highlight">class Program {
    static void Main(string[] args) {

        Console.WriteLine("Starting Web Job Application");

        Stopwatch timer = new Stopwatch();
        timer.Start();

        Console.WriteLine(DateTime.Now);

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 15; i++) {
            WriteInfo(i);
            Thread.Sleep(500);
        }

        timer.Stop();
        Console.WriteLine("Web Job Procession took: " + timer.Elapsed.Seconds + " seconds");

        Console.WriteLine("Finished Web Job Application");
    }

    static void WriteInfo(int number) {
        Console.WriteLine("Working on item: " + number);
    }
}
</pre>
<p>With the use of “Console.WriteLine” you can post message on the WebJob console. Within Azure there are two types of WebJobs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuous: Actions are taken when for example a item is added in a Queue.</li>
<li>On demand: Actions run on demand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides these two option you are also able to schedule WebJobs. This can be done by using the old portal or by publishing the WebJob with Visual Studio.</p>
<p>The following actions are displayed in the video:</p>
<ul>
<li>What can run on Azure</li>
<li>Create a Azure Web App</li>
