<p>For some time now I have been following information about SharePoint 14 that finds its way to blogs or news sites. In that time I have found a large amount of information that I would like to share with you.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago Microsoft announced that the new version of SharePoint will be known as SharePoint 2010.</p>
<p>Microsoft also announced that SharePoint also known as “Microsoft Office SharePoint Server” will not be called “MOSS” anymore because they cut off the “Office” part so it will be “Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010”.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Preliminary system requirements for SharePoint Server 2010 have been made available by Microsoft. These requirements are:</p>
<p>· SharePoint Server 2010 will be 64-bit only. </p>
<p>· SharePoint Server 2010 will require 64-bit Windows Server 2008 or 64-bit Windows Server 2008 R2. </p>
<p>· SharePoint Server 2010 will require 64-bit SQL Server 2008 or 64-bit SQL Server 2005</p>
<p>When you install Service Pack 2 of SharePoint 2007 you can check whether your Farm is ready to upgrade to the next version when it comes available. You can do this by using the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd793607.aspx">Upgrade Checker</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft also announced that it will not support Internet Explorer 6. </p>
<p><em>“From the SharePoint Team blog: SharePoint 2010 will be “targeting standards based browsers (XHTML 1.0 compliant) including Internet Explorer 7, Internet Explorer 8 and Firefox 3.x. running on Windows Operating Systems. In addition we’re planning on an increased level of compatibility with Firefox 3.x and Safari 3.x on non-Windows Operating Systems,” according to the SharePoint Team Blog.”</em></p>
<p>The architecture will not change as it did between SharePoint Server 2003 to Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007. This for insuring that there will be less compatibility issues and a smoother upgrade path (in theory).</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<p>Not many features are announced for SharePoint 2010. Some features are announced or are simply speculations. Below you can find a list of features that have been announced or are speculations.</p>
<p>· Claims-based authentication, authentication that is based on other authentication systems like LiveID.</p>
<p>· Web based functionalities for InfoPath.</p>
<p>· SQL Table like behavior for SharePoint lists.</p>
<p>· Filters for indexing of PDF and ODF Files.</p>
<p>· Integration with Jquery.</p>
<p>· Support for OpenXML</p>
<p>· CMIS support will allow interoperability between SharePoint 2010 and other content management systems</p>
<p>· SharePoint 2010 will feature a “Web-enabled Ribbon control” and support greater use of Silverlight controls</p>
<p>· SharePoint as archive for Exchange server</p>
<p>According to Microsoft officials Office 2010 will become available to a wider cross-section testers starting this July. This will be the Community Technology Preview (CTP) test build of Office 2010. This test build will not include SharePoint Server. In July the SharePoint 2010 beta/technology preview will be invitation-only and will focus on a number of its enterprise customers and target specific enterprise deployment scenarios.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Later this year, a public beta will launch for both SharePoint Server 2010 and Project Server 2010.</p>
<p>When the CTP of SharePoint 2010 is available we will learn much more about SharePoint 2010. If some of you know more information about SharePoint 2010 let me know by leaving a comment or sending me an e-mail. When the information is useful I will update this post.</p>
