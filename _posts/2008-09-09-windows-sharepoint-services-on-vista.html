<p>It has been there for a while WSS on Vista but I never tried it out. Last night I had some spare time so I thought let’s give it a try on my home desktop machine where I’m running Vista Business.</p>
<p>At first I thought I would get in a lot of trouble installing WSS on my Vista Machine, but after installing IIS it all went like a charm. After IIS I downloaded SQL 2008 Express edition from the Microsoft site and installed it on my machine. After that I was ready to begin with the installation of WSS.</p>
<p>I followed the steps that are explained on the Community site of Bamboo: <br />BamBoo How To Install WSS on Vista</p>
<p>After I followed those steps it worked great and I am now using my desktop PC for development against the SharePoint object model.</p>
<p>Tanks Bamboo for this great solution, and for all the SharePoint guys that have vista installed, you should really try this out!</p>
