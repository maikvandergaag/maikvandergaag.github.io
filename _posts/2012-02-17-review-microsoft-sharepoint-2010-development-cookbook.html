<p>Recently I have been asked to review a new SharePoint 2010 book named “<a href="http://www.packtpub.com/microsoft-sharepoint-2010-development-from-beginner-to-professional-cookbook/book">Microsoft SharePoint 2010 Development Cookbook</a>” written by Ed Musters.</p>
<p>When I received the book I expected a book with a lot of recipes to get things done in SharePoint. <img style="float: right; display: inline;" src="/assets/archive/2012/02/1506EN_cov.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="247" align="right" />The sub-title off the book “Over 45 recipes to take you from beginner to professional in SharePoint Development” made me expect to really learn how things are done within SharePoint.</p>
<p>The book starts off with a recipe to create a SharePoint development environment. The way this is done in the book is not that representative to a real world scenario. Installing everything on the same account van cause serious issues when you are working within DTAP environments.</p>
<p>The rest of the book consists off all kind of different recipes that you can use separately. The main problem that I had with the recipes was that they don’t go very deep into the subject. This makes the sub-title from beginner to professional not really true.</p>
<p>It was ok to read this book but I do not recommend it!!</p>
