<p>Azure Resource Manager policies provide you with the ability to manage risk within you Azure environment. You can write policies to enforce certain situations.</p>
<ul>
<li>A policy setting is default set to allow.</li>
<li>Policies are described by policy definitions in a policy definition language (if-then conditions).</li>
<li>You create polices with JSON formatted files.</li>
</ul>
<p>Policies that you have defined can be assigned to certain scopes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subscription</li>
<li>Resource Group</li>
<li>Resource type</li>
</ul>
<p>Within the definition of the policies you can define the below actions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deny</strong>: Blocks the resource request</li>
<li><strong>Audit</strong>: Allows the request but adds a line to the activity log. These can be used to start action within Azure Automation.</li>
<li><strong>Append</strong>: Adds specified information to the resource. For example tagging the resource with useful information.</li>
</ul>
<p>I started to create Azure Resource Manager Policies and created a GitHub repository to save them and share them.</p>
<p>Within this repository you have the option to add policies and work together on them to get a default set of policies.</p>
<p>The repository also contains a script files to assign the policies to specific resources.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>One of the policies within the repository is a policy to ensure that resources are created within the Europe regions.</p>
<p>The policy is described in if-then conditions, if the resource is not created in West-Europe (westeurope) or North-Europe (northeurope) the creation of the resource will be declined (deny).</p>
<pre class="highlight">{
    "$schema": "http://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-10-01-preview/policyDefinition.json",
    "if": {
        "not": {
            "field": "location",
            "in" : ["northeurope" , "westeurope"]
        }
    },
    "then": {
     "effect": "deny"   
    }
}
</pre>
<p>In the policy file the schema file specified to get type-ahead functionality within JSON editors.</p>
<p>This policy can be assigned to a resource with executing two PowerShell commands:</p>
<ol>
<li>New-AzureRmPolicyDefinition</li>
<li>New-AzureRmPolicyAssignment</li>
</ol>
<p>With the first command the definition is created, and saved to a PowerShell object.</p>
<pre class="highlight">$policy = New-AzureRmPolicyDefinition -Name [Policy Name] -Description [Policy Description] -Policy [Path to Policy JSON File]
</pre>
<p>The second command is then used to assign the policy to a certain scope.</p>
<pre class="highlight">New-AzureRmPolicyAssignment -Name [Policy Name] -PolicyDefinition $policy -Scope [Scope]
</pre>
<p>Putting everything together and making the script as generic as possible you have the following script to assign a policy to a resource group.</p>
<pre class="highlight">$policyName = Read-Host "Specify the name of the policy";
$policyDescription = Read-Host "Specify the description of the policy"
$policyFile = Read-Host "Path to json policy file";
$resourceGroup = Read-Host "Specify the resource group";

#Login to the Azure Resource Management Account
Login-AzureRmAccount

#Let the user choose the right subscrition
Write-Host "---------------------------------------------------------------------"
Write-Host "Your current subscriptions: " -ForegroundColor Yellow
Get-AzureRMSubscription
Write-Host "Enter the Subscription ID to deploy to: " -ForegroundColor Green
$sub = Read-Host 
Set-AzureRmContext -SubscriptionId $sub
clear

$subId = (Get-AzureRmContext).Subscription.SubscriptionId
$subName = (Get-AzureRmContext).Subscription.SubscriptionName

Write-Host "Policy is applied to the resource group: $resourceGroup in subscription: $subName"
$policy = New-AzureRmPolicyDefinition -Name $policyName -Description $policyDescription -Policy $policyFile;

#Assign the Azure Policy
New-AzureRmPolicyAssignment -Name $policyName -PolicyDefinition $policy -Scope "/subscriptions/$sub/resourceGroups/$resourcegroup"
</pre>
<p>After assigning the policy and trying to create a resource in another region will result in a error message. Sometimes this can still be a really descriptive message as shown in the image below.</p>
