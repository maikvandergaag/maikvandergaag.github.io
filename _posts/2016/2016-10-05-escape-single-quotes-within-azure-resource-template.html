<p>In some situations you will get into problems when creating a Azure Resource Template. I was creating a solution for a customer and had to add a Logic App to our template. That isn’t that hard I thought but when adding a Logic App to your template and making it parameterized and depending on other resources you can come into scenario’s were you will have to escape single quotes.</p>
<p>Looking into the documentation about azure resource templates you will not find any solution (I haven’t) so I tried a couple of escape characters and they didn’t work.</p>
<p>The last resort was a solution that isn’t that pretty but it works, I hope that in new releases this will be fixed.</p>
<h2>Create a Variable</h2>
<p>The first step for the solution is to create a variable in the template that contains a single quote.</p>
<pre class="highlight">"variables": {
  "singlequote": "'"
}
</pre>
<h2>Use the variable</h2>
<p>After you created the variable you can use this to combine you string values.</p>
<pre class="highlight"> "uri": "[concat('https://', reference(concat('Microsoft.Web/sites/', parameters('api_Name'))).defaultHostName, '/api/Item/', '@{encodeURIComponent(body(',variables('singlequote'), 'HTTP_GetItem',variables('singlequote'), ')?[', variables('singlequote'),'itemid_value', variables('singlequote'), '])}')]"
</pre>
<p>As you can see in the above code snip it we set the “uri” property of a Logic App component. In this specific snipt it we dynamically get the hostname of a Azure Web Site the Logic App depends on. Further up in the “uri” we need single quotes as you can see by adding the variable ‘singlequote’.</p>
