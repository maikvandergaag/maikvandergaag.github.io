<p>This weekend my employer <a href="http://www.motion10.nl/">Motion10</a> hosted one of the many <a href="http://global.azurebootcamp.net/" target="_blank">Global Azure Bootcamp</a> around the world. Where I presented about Azure Web Application.</p>
<p>This year there where 161 confirmed event locations, that held a one-day deep dive class to help thousands of people get up to speed on developing solutions for Azure.</p>
<p>During this day I had the honor to present about Azure Web Applications, and two colleagues of my presented about other parts of Azure: <a href="http://ithero.com/">Tomasso Groenendijk (Azure MVP)</a> and <a href="https://phvbaars.wordpress.com/">Paul Baars</a> .</p>
<p>With this blog I want to share all the information I created and shared with the attendants of the event hoping to get you up to speed as well.</p>
<h2>Labs</h2>
<p>Within the package you con download at the bottom of the blog (available on MSDN samples) you will find three labs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lab 1 - Getting started with Azure Web Apps and ASP.NET</li>
<li>Lab 2 - Azure Web Apps and Visual Studio Team Services</li>
<li>Lab 3 - Azure Web Apps and Azure Table Storage</li>
</ul>
<p>The sample package also contains a solution. In that solution the outcome of Lab 3 is added. The outcome of Lab 3 is a MVC Web Application that connects to Azure Table Storage and performs some basic CRUD operations.</p>
<h3>Lab 1</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lab 1 while give a short introduction on how to work with Azure Web Applications and Visual Studio. During this lab you will create a Azure Web Application and deploy source files from Visual Studio to Azure.</p>
<h3>Lab 2</h3>
<p>Lab 2 while give a introduction on how to work with Azure Web Applications and continuous integration with Visual Studio Team Services. By using the Azure Portal you will setup continuous integration with an account you create within Visual Studio Team Services.</p>
<h3>Lab 3</h3>
<p>Lab 3 while give you a introduction on how to work with Azure Table Storage and Azure Web Applications. You will define basic CRUD operations to Create, Read, Update and Delete Table storage data. The source files within the solution contain all the code to perform the basic CRUD operations.</p>
