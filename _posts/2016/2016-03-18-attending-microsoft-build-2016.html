<p>I love attending conferences that contain great content and especially when this content is delivered by Program Managers or Evangelists from Microsoft. I have been to a few conferences  and one of the best conferences I attended was TechEd 2014 in Barcelona.</p>
<p>A conference I still wanted to attend was Build .</p>
<p><em>“Build is an annual conference event held by Microsoft, aimed towards software and web developers using Windows, Windows Phone, Microsoft Azure and other Microsoft technologies. First held in 2011, it serves as a successor for Microsoft's previous developer events, the Professional Developers Conference (an infrequent event which covered development of software for the Windows operating system) and MIX (which covered web development centering on Microsoft technology such as Silverlight and ASP.net).”</em></p>
<p>I was really disappointed that I got placed on the waiting list after just 5 minutes but a few weeks back I received a email that I had been registered. Meaning that at the end of this month I will be in San Francisco to attend Microsoft Build for the first time and I’m expecting a lot off great content.</p>
<p>On this <a href="https://msftplayground.com" target="_blank">blog</a> and on <a href="https://twitter.com/maikvandergaag" target="_blank">twitter</a> I will try to keep you posted on great announcements during the conference.</p>
<p>If you’re at Build and you follow me, be sure to send me a message or tweet and we’ll meet up!</p>
