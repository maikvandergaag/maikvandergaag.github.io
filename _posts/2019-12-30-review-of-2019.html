<p>For a couple of years, I have been doing a lot of community<br />
work. The most of it was blogging on the various platforms I had during the<br />
last decade. This year I wanted to take it even further and do a lot more<br />
things in which I failed miserably.</p>

<h2>Family</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>2019 has been on great and amazing on one side and a very hard one on the other side. Personally, I had great moments like the birth of my son <a href="https://msftplayground.com/2019/05/the-past-three-months-of-a-technology-junkie/">Jurre</a> but also a lot of worrier about my kids. But he, if I didn’t want to worry about my kids, I shouldn’t have taken them right ?. One thing is for certain they are the best thing that has ever happened to me.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One thing is also trough because of the worries and the restful<br />
nights I have got into as much stuff as I have wanted that is a pity, but family<br />
comes first and that leaves me to an even better 2020.</p>

<h2>Dutch Cloud Meetup</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In January I started one of my long-lasting ideas in<br />
reaching out to the community on a regular base but also suppling the community<br />
with regular events in and around Rotterdam. I made this choose because most of<br />
the events in the Netherlands are held in Amsterdam which is a hassle to travel<br />
to after a hard day of work.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>That why I founded the <a href="http://dutchcloudmeetup.online/">Dutch Cloud Meetup</a> and asked Henry<br />
Been to help me organize event. This year we already had two great events. One<br />
at my employer <a href="https://3fifty.eu/">3fifty</a> and another at <a href="https://ibis.nl/">Ibis</a>. For the year 2020 we have even more events<br />
planned and are working for a large event in March with an international speaker.</p>

<h2>Author</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Another opportunity I got this year was the ability to be a technical<br />
reviewer of a book that is being written by Henry Been. After reviewing a<br />
couple of chapters I have even been asked as a Co-author for a chapter in the<br />
book. I accepted and the book will be published somewhere in the beginning of<br />
2020.</p>

<h2>Speaking Engagements</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Next to blogging I wanted to start with speaking as different<br />
events. Because of personally situations I have not been able to speak at as<br />
many events as I wanted but have been able to do a few:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Govern your Azure platform with Azure Policies @<br />
Dutch Cloud Meetup</li>
<li>Evolving PowerShell scripts into Azure Pipeline<br />
extensions @ SDN Event</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you are ever looking for a speaker that a look at my<br />
speaker profile on <a href="https://sessionize.com/maikvandergaag/">Sessionize</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Forthcoming</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>All together it has been an amazing year with a lot of opportunities<br />
and other nice things. All together I can’t wait until 2020 will start and all<br />
the nice things I will be able to do and start.</p>

<p>In 2020 you can also expect a lot more blog post from me.</p>
