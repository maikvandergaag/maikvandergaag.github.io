<p>For a project we were working on we created a web application with a wrong application pool Identity. We wanted to set this correctly and we thought we could just change the application pool Identity in IIS, but we were wrong.</p>
<p>What happens was that the application pool identity was changed back by SharePoint in a period off time. When we saw this happening we began to look how we could change the application pool account in SharePoint.</p>
<p>Navigate to ‘Central Administration’ and click on the operations tab.</p>

<p>Click on ‘Service Accounts’ that is highlighted in the image above. In the screen that follows change the boxes to the preferences you want. For a ‘Web Application’ Identity you have to select the radio button ‘Web Application pool’ and select the correct preferences.</p>
