<p>The new cumulative update for Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 and Windows SharePoint Services is available for you to apply to you server farm.</p>
<p>The Microsoft SharePoint Team blog states:</p>
<p><em>“However, unless customers are affected by the problem described in the KB articles, and already have Dec CU applied, we do not suggest them to apply these new update packages. </em></p>
<p><em>The “Uber” package for Feb CU is scheduled to be released in the coming weeks. The update packages released now are a subset of the whole Uber package. These update packages do not include DLC (Document Lifecycle), IFS(InfoPath Forms Services) and XLSRV(Excel Calculation Services) updates. So, if customers apply them directly on a SharePoint installation which does not have Dec CU applied, they will miss the updates of those mentioned components. “</em></p>
<p>You can download the cumulative updates from here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows SharePoint Services 3.0</strong> – 961750 Global <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/961750">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/961750</a>  </li>
<li><strong>Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 – </strong>967703 Language specific <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/967703">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/967703</a>  </li>
<li><strong>Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 &amp; Microsoft Search Server 2008</strong> – 961749 Global <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/961749">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/961749</a>  </li>
<li><strong>Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 &amp; Microsoft Search Server 2008</strong> – 91754 Language specific <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/961754">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/961754</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to install the updates on your farm I would recommend the following sequence:</p>
<ul>
<li>961750  </li>
<li>967703  </li>
<li>961749  </li>
<li>961754</li>
</ul>
<p>Just like the Microsoft SharePoint Team blog stats it is better to wait for the uber package especially when you do not have the December Cumulative update installed.</p>
