<div class="ExternalClass70246CECBDF14275AFE1637B37FE9E6F">
<p>In January of this year I wrote a post about creating a virtual earth web part (You can read about it <a href="/2009/01/virtual-earth-webpart/">here</a>). I had done this by adding JavaScript to the page.</p>
<p>When I was talking to one of my colleges (<a href="http://linktosql.wordpress.com/">blog</a>) a week ago after a team meeting he told me that there is also an ASP.Net Server Control made available by Microsoft. I was curious and I went looking on the internet and found the site where you can download the control and some other great server controls (<a href="#">here</a>).</p>
<p>The controls that Microsoft made available is a package called “Windows Live Tools for Microsoft Visual Studio”. This package contains the following controls:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contacts:</strong> Provides Windows Live Contacts functionality on a Web page.  </li>
<li><strong>IDLoginStatus: </strong>Provides Windows Live ID authentication on a Web page.  </li>
<li><strong>IDLoginView:</strong> Provides Windows Live ID authentication, including support for associating a Windows Live ID with an ASP.NET membership profile, on a Web page.  </li>
<li><strong>Map:</strong> Provides Virtual Earth Map functionality on a Web page.  </li>
<li><strong>MessengerChat:</strong> Provides Windows Live Messenger access on a Web page.  </li>
<li><strong>SilverlightStreamingMediaPlayer:</strong> Provides Silverlight™ Streaming media content on a Web page.</li>
</ul>
<p>So take a look at the tools site (http://dev.live.com/tools/) from Microsoft and use the controls in your web application when they come in handy.</p>
