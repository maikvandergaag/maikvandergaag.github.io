<div class="ExternalClass24C39A70C3904468A7BE789DF8A05368">
<p>Since a few days I have installed Internet Explorer 8 on my computer and I was curious how it would display certain sites. Till a few hours ago everything looked nice. </p>
<p>When navigating to an internet site we had just developed for one of our clients I noticed a strange thing. On the default page we added a custom control that inherits from the ASP Menu. The hover of that menu wasn’t working anymore in IE8.</p>
<p>After searching on Google I found an solution for this problem ( here ) and I also found another possible solution (<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/mhildreth/archive/2009/01/26/testing.aspx">here tanks to Mark Hildreth’s</a>). The problem is caused by IE8 because it does not handle the z-index off the page right. You can fix this problem by doing the following:</p>
<p>Create a new class in your CSS file or place it in your web page:</p>
<pre class="highlight"> .aspmenufix
 {
     z-index: 1;
 }</pre>
<p>In the ASP menu control you have to add the following:</p>
<pre class="highlight">&lt;asp:Menu ID="Menu1" runat="server"&gt;
    &lt;DynamicMenuStyle CssClass="aspmenufix" /&gt;
&lt;/asp:Menu&gt;</pre>
<p>I hope this will help everyone who uses the ASP Menu in his website!</p>
