<div class="ExternalClass5B9E87AA45C841DB9C4A8F68EF026440">Often people ask me a question why Windows keeps prompting to login when you open a document from SharePoint. To automatically login you can change the settings that I have written down in this blog post: <a href="/2008/12/sharepoint-prompts-to-login-multiple-time-when-opening-a-document/">SharePoint prompts to login multiple time when opening a document</a> If you still have problems with windows that keeps prompting for credentials you should not stop the WebClient service like many blogs give as solution. Stopping this service <strong>is</strong> a resolution for this problem but not <strong>the correct</strong> solution. When you stop this service other problems can occur like:
<ul>
<li>When you open a document from SharePoint and press “Save” the save dialog will not open with the document library but with a local folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>But what is the resolution I hear you thinking! The resolution for vista is a registry key setting.
<ol>
<li>Go to start – run, and type regedit.  </li>
<li>When the registry editor window opens go to this path:
<ul>
<li>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE – SYSTEM – CurrentControlSet – Services – WebClient – Parameters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Right-click the ‘Parameters’ subkey and create a new Multi-String Value.  </li>
<li>Give the Multi-String Value the name ‘AuthForwardServerList’.  </li>
<li>Open the new value and type in the list of SharePoint server URL’s that are trusted and click ‘Ok’  </li>
<li>Close the registry editor.  </li>
<li>Reboot your PC or restart the WebClient Service : start – Administrative Tools - Services</li>
</ol>
<p>The steps I have written down should work on a PC with Windows Vista SP1. If you guys have found another solution please let me know by placing a comment. </p></div>
