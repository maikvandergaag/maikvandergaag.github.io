<div class="ExternalClassCEB55FABFC024D0A8B5504AA86284A59">
<p>Almost two years ago I started "Blog About SharePoint" to blog about SharePoint related subjects.</p>
<p>The last couple of months my focus has changed to more Microsoft products so I have created a new blog called "<a href="http://msftplayground.com">Microsoft Playground</a>". Microsoft Playground will be a blog for articles regarding all kind of Microsoft technologies. I hope you guys will enjoy "<a href="http://msftplayground.com">Microsoft Playground</a>" as much as you have enjoyed "Blog About SharePoint". RSS feed : <a href="http://msftplayground.com/feed/">Microsoft Playground</a></p>
