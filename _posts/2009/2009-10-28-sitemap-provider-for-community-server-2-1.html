<div class="ExternalClassCEF2ADF3D39941D0A7A3552329C67CDC">
<p>For my new blog I had to create a sitemap provider to provide my content to several search engines.</p>
<p>Because I did not find any solution on the internet I thought I would share my solution with you guys:</p>
<p>You can download the source here: <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/MSFTPlayground.Sitemap.zip">MSFTPlayground.Sitemap.zip</a> </p>
<p>The provider is meant for one blog. In the definitions file within the solution you can change the properties for you blog. You only have to add a httphandler to your web.config just like it is done in the file “web.config(extension)” within the solution. </p>
<p>Let me know what you guys think of this provider.</p>
