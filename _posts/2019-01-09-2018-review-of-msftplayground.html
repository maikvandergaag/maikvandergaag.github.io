<p>One of the things I like to do is sharing knowledge with the Community. I started my website in 2008 and last year I noticed that I have been blogging for 10 years. My first post was from 27-03-2008 and I still love writing articles.</p>


<p>In 2018 I became a member of the  AIMS Performance Pro team because of me knowledge on Azure and other related topics.  The AIMS performance Pro team (#aimsperformancepro) is a program for ambitious and outspoken technical professionals who have interests in the intersection of IT integration, monitoring, analytics, performance tuning and troubleshooting. </p>


<p>In 2018 I investigated a lot of community options to be able to participate more in the community. Besides my Azure DevOps extensions (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://msftplayground.com/extensions/" target="_blank">https://msftplayground.com/extensions/</a>) I'm also investigating the possibility to start a meetup group to get the community together in 2019. </p>
