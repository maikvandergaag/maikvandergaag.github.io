<div class="ExternalClass2FFF1A9D23B0417FB575C4D4105DB0E9">
<p>During my last projects I have been asked the same questions. The question was how can you get the normal name of a SharePoint field name that is encoded like this: Test_x0020_ Name.</p>
<p>The field names get encoded because XML elements names can’t contain spaces or other different characters. In the example above the x0020 represents the space and the _ represents a delimiter.</p>
<p>You can decode those SharePoint fields by using:</p>
<pre class="highlight">System.XML.XmlConvert.DecodeName("[Fieldname]") ;</pre>
<p>You can encode fieldnames if you would like by using:</p>
<pre class="highlight">System.XML.XmlConvert.EncodeName("[FieldName]")</pre>
</div>
<p>Hope this helps you when developing for SharePoint and remember when you have questions about Microsoft technology don't be afraid to ask.</p>
