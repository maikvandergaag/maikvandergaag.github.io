<div class="ExternalClass8DB1FC39FFC646D086CAED17645A46E3">
<p>Today I was working on some cool features to update the User Profile store in SharePoint 2010. To test this feature I usually use a Console Application. In my Console Application I was keep getting an error on a line like below: </p>
<pre class="highlight">UserProfileManager profileConfigManager = new UserProfileManager(ServiceContext);</pre>
<p>The exception I kept getting was : 'No User Profile Application available to service the request. Contact your farm administrator.' I made sure the User Profile Application was running correctly and it was. I already clicked on the "Administrators" button in the toolbar of the Service Application to give me Full Control, but it still wasn't working.</p>
<p>Till I noticed that there is also a 'Permissions' button. I clicked the button and saw that my current user wasn't in the permissions box. I gave my user 'Full Control' and now everything works great from the console application. </p>
<p>Happy Coding! </p>
