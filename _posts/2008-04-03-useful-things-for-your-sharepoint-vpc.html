<p>On several sites there are postings about tools you could have on you SharePoint development VPC. That’s why I thought lets post what I have got on my development VPC. If you do not have a Virtual PC with SharePoint you can take a look at the following posts of Tony Zink. He made 20 posts for making your own VPC with SharePoint (I made my VPC with that article):</p>
<p>How to Create a MOSS 2007 VPC Image, The whole nine yards</p>
<p>In the article you will see that you have to run windows update so that you have all the current updates available for windows 2003. I mainly work in an environment where I can’t access windows update, when you are also in an environment like this you can try: <a href="http://www.autopatcher.com">Autopatcher</a></p>
