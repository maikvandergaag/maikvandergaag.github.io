<div class="ExternalClassB9CD693B03AA477CB826421785DD9CE4">A few day’s ago I stumbled on a article about SharePoint Memory leaks because we were looking at memory leaks for 1 of out clients. I found a great article from Todd Carter about a giant memory leak within SharePoint that he found just a month ago. It is really a must read: SharePoint’s Sasquatch Memory Leak</div>
