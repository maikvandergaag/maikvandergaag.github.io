<p><strong>Update:</strong>Version 2.0 available of the script <a href="/2009/02/scheduling-sharepoint-backup-part-2/">here</a></p>
<p>For one of our clients we had to schedule the SharePoint Backup what isn’t possible trough the interface, so we went looking for some possible solutions. The solutions we came across are: </p>
<ul>
<li>Performing the backup every time by hand (isn’t scheduling after all).  </li>
<li>Creating a batch file to perform the backup. And schedule it in windows with scheduled tasks.  </li>
<li>Creating a VBScript for the backup and scheduling it in windows with scheduled tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>We choose the third solution because we found a create article on the internet from Rabi Achrafi. In this article he shows his version of a VBScript he used. The great thing about the script was that it sends an e-mail to a specified e-mail address when the job is finished and gives back the completion status of the job. The script did not completely cover our needs so we changed the file a little bit. The main thanks still goes out to Rabi Achrafi. Besides the small things we changed we also added a method for deleting all the files that reside in the shared folder. Because those files where already taped. The file we created looked something like this: </p>
