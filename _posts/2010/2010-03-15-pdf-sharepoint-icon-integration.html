<div class="ExternalClassCFB2B6FDB30E451CAD96C8FC1F72BE48">
<p>A few months ago I have created a solution to automatically add a icon (PDF) to your SharePoint farm. I never had the change to test it on a multiple server farm. Last week I had the change to test it and altered it in several ways. The blog posts I made of the old solution can be found here: <a title="Feature for adding a Icon to your SharePoint farm" href="/2009/06/feature-for-adding-a-icon-to-your-sharepoint-farm/">Feature for adding a Icon to your SharePoint farm</a> I have placed the new solution on <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/spiconintegration">CodePlex</a>: <strong>Description (SharePoint Icon Integration)</strong> SharePoint Icon Integration makes it easier for SharePoint Administrators / Developers to add a icon (PDF) to the SharePoint farm.</p>
<p>You will no longer have to alter the DocIcon.xml file manually. The solution is developed in C# and works in a multiple farm environment. <a href="http://spiconintegration.codeplex.com/releases">Download</a> <a href="http://spiconintegration.codeplex.com/SourceControl/list/changesets">Source Code</a></p>
