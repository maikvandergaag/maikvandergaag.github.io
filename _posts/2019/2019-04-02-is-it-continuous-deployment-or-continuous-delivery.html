<p>The terms<br />
Continuous Deployment and Continuous Delivery are most of the time mistaken<br />
with each other. The abbreviation CD is sometime used for Continuous Deployment<br />
and sometimes used for Continuous Delivery! Hack I even use the terms in wrong<br />
situations were I forget to mention the right one, but there is a real<br />
difference between the two.</p>


<h2>Continuous Deployment</h2>


<p>As we want<br />
to keep things simple Continuous Deployment is nothing more then deploying<br />
every code change to production. </p>


<h2>Continuous Delivery</h2>


<p>To explain<br />
Continuous Delivery, more words are needed. &nbsp;Let’s start by looking at the definition of<br />
DevOps from Donovan Brown:</p>


<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable Continuous Delivery of value to our end users”</p>
<p><cite>Donovan Brown</cite></p></blockquote>


<p>When looking at the definition you will notice that Continuous Delivery is an enabler for the DevOps practices. Based on this we can say that Continuous Delivery is a set of tools, processes and techniques for rapid, reliable and continuous development and delivery of software a definition defined by "Martin Fowler".</p>


<p>This really<br />
means that Continuous Delivery means more than just releasing software. This<br />
can also be extracted from the eight principles of Continuous Delivery:</p>


<ol>
<li>The process for releasing/deploying<br />
software must be repeatable and reliable.</li>
<li>Automate everything!</li>
<li>If something is difficult or<br />
painful, do it more often. </li>
<li>Keep everything in source control.</li>
<li>Done means “released.” </li>
<li>Build quality in! </li>
<li>Everybody has responsibility for the<br />
release process.</li>
<li>Improve continuously</li>
</ol>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>


<p>Combining the eight principles and the definition of Donovan Brown makes Continuous Delivery the real enabler for the DevOps practices were the term is not only a certain form of release management but much more.</p>
