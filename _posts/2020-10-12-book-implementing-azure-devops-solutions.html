<p id="tw-target-text">The last year I have worked with Henry Been to write the book: Implementing Azure DevOps Solutions. Henry has written the largest part of the book were I was responsible for chapter 12 and part of the reviewing.</p>


<p>Implementing Azure DevOps solutions helps DevOps engineers and administrators use Azure DevOps Services to master practices such as continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI / CD), containerization, and downtime deployments.</p>


<p>The book: Implementing Azure DevOps Solutions, by Henry Been and Maik van der Gaag starts with the foundation of continuous integration, continuous delivery and automated implementations. You will then learn how to apply configuration management and infrastructure as code (IaC), along with managing databases in DevOps scenarios. Next, you will discuss adjusting security and compliance with DevOps. As you progress, you will discover how to instrument applications and collect statistics to understand application usage and user behavior. </p>


<h2>Container build strategy</h2>


<p>The last part of this book helps you implement a container build strategy and manage Azure Kubernetes Services. Finally, understand how to create your own Azure DevOps organization, along with quick tips and tricks to apply effective DevOps practices with confidence. </p>


<p>By the end of this book, you will have gained the knowledge you need to ensure seamless application deployment and business continuity. </p>
