<p>For a couple of days we have been trying to connect our On-Premise SharePoint 2013 environment with our On-Premise BizTalk 2013 environment using the SharePoint adapter.</p>
<p>During this process we encountered several errors that I would like to share with you.</p>
<p>After configuring the SharePoint Adapter (you can read about it on MSDN <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj684553(v=bts.80).aspx">here</a>) and trying to send our first document we encountered the first error message:</p>
<p><em>The adapter failed to transmit message going to send port "SendPort-SP" with URL "wss://sharepointsite.com:80/sites/data/DropOffLibrary". It will be retransmitted after the retry interval specified for this Send Port. Details:"The Windows SharePoint Services site was not found. The URL "</em><em>http://sharepointsite.com:80/sites/data/DropOffLibrary</em><em>" points to a SharePoint object for which there is no Windows SharePoint Services site.</em>
<p>Resolving this error is relatively easy. By enabling the “Windows Identity Framework” (WIF) within Windows Server 2012 this error will be resolved (Thanks <a href="http://www.solidsoft.com/blog/posts/2013/biztalk-integration-with-sharepoint-2013-online-%E2%80%93-troubleshooting.aspx">Vincent Rouet</a>).
<p>The second error that we received look like this:
<p><em>A message sent to adapter "Windows SharePoint Services" on send port "SharePoint" with URI "wsss://sharepointsite.com:80/sites/data/DropOffLibrary" is suspended. </em>
<p><em> Error details: [System.ServiceModel.CommunicationObjectFaultedException] The communication object, System.ServiceModel.Channels.ServiceChannel, cannot be used for communication because it is in the Faulted state.</em>
<p>Reading about this error concluded that this had to be some kind of security issue. We had filled in a domain user in the “SharePoint Online Password”&nbsp; and “SharePoint Online Username“ field of the adapter. When we changed the right properties to a Office 365 location using a Online login account everything seemed to be working fine.
<p>Leaving the “SharePoint Online Password”&nbsp; and “SharePoint Online Username“ field of the adapter empty raised a security exception. After some logical thinking we figured out the the account running the host should have access to the SharePoint.
<p>So what we did is creating a separate Host within BizTalk with a specific domain account and attach it to the SharePoint adapter. When you then leave the “SharePoint Online Password”&nbsp; and “SharePoint Online Username“ fields empty it will use the account that is specified for the host to add the documents to SharePoint.</p></p></p></p></p>
