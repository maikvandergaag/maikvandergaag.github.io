<p>Problems can occur when you are trying to re-install Windows SharePoint Services. The problem occurred when I was trying to install the Dutch version off WSS after I uninstalled the English version.</p>
<p>The Installation of WSS went ok, but when I tried to configure WSS it did not worked correctly.</p>
<p>After some searching I found out that WSS installs his own SQL Server instance but does not uninstall the instance when you remove WSS.</p>
<p>But how do you remove this instance? You cannot uninstall this instance with the normal tools of SQL Server 2005 so you have to do this another way.</p>
<p>1) Using regedit to locate the following registry key:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall</p>
<p>2) Under this registry key search for “Embedded”. On the left side of the screen, click the GUID that is found with the search. Copy the value under the key named: “UninstallString”.</p>
<p>3) Go to the command prompt and then paste the string. Now, write the following after the string and press enter:</p>
<p>CALLERID=OCSETUP.EXE</p>
<p>4) An Uninstall program will start.</p>
<p>Know you have uninstalled the instance and you can safely install your version off WSS.</p>
