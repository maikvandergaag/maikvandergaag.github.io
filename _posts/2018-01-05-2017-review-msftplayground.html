<p>One of the things I like to do is sharing knowledge with the Community. I started my blog in 2008 and changed the platform a couple of times from WordPress to SharePoint and BlogEngine.Net to SharePoint to WordPress again.</p>
<p>In 2017 my blog grew from 201 posts to 231 posts and the views on my pages grew enormous. With a top of 732 views on one day.</p>
<p>Beside my blog I continued to use other things in 2017 and started something new:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/maikvandergaag">Twitter</a>: Continued to use twitter more actively.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/msftplayground">Facebook</a>: I continued to use a Facebook page for my blog.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/MaikvanderGaag">GitHub</a>: I continued to use GitHub to share code and knowledge.</li>
<li><a href="https://msftplayground.com/extensions/">Visual Studio Team Services Extensions</a>: I started creating extensions for Visual Studio Team Services.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Users and Page views</h2>
<p>In 2016 the blog had 66,976 (11,000 more than 2016) unique users and had 98,377 page views (23,000 more than 2016).</p>
