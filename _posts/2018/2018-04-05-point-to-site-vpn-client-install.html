<p>To connect an Azure App Service to a on-premise database you can make use of different solutions. Two of those solutions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hybrid Connection</li>
<li>VPN</li>
</ul>
<p>On my blog I wrote a couple of articles on Hybrid Connections and this time I was working with the VPN connection.  For a project we were setting up the connection using the following documentation from Microsoft:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-rm-ps">Configure a Point-to-Site connection to a VNet using native Azure certificate authentication: PowerShell</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>VPN Client Installation</h2>
<p>When we tried to install the VPN Client nothing happened. After clicking, rebooting and trying for a while it still didn’t install and I opened the event viewer and found the following message:</p>
<pre class="highlight">Activation of app Microsoft.Windows.Apprep.ChxApp_cw5n1h2txyewy:App.AppXc99k5qnnsvxj5szemm7fp3g7y08we5vm.mca failed with error: This app can't be activated by the Built-in Administrator. See the Microsoft-Windows-TWinUI/Operational log for additional information.
</pre>

<p>This message remembered me off something I experienced a couple of years ago with an installer, I created myself. Because the installer is created from another machine the file is blocked by default and needs to be unblocked.</p>

<p>Beside that image I also created an animated version:</p>
<p><a href="/assets/archive/2018/04/VPNClient.gif"><img class="alignnone" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="VPN Client Animated" src="/assets/archive/2018/04/VPNClient_thumb.gif" alt="VPN Client Animated" width="169" height="240" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>After unblocking the installer the VPN installation worked perfectly.</p>
