<p>As a SharePoint developer you do not often get the question what SharePoint version do we need to install. In many situations we see that the Enterprise license is installed.</p>
<p>For a project Iâ€™m currently working on I got the question to stick to the SharePoint 2013 Standard license. Having this requirement we were looking for a list of features we could use within a Standard license.</p>
<p>Searching on the internet supplied as a lot of resources but all these resources were all very different.</p>
<p>Finally we found a link that pointed us to a TechNet article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-US/library/jj819267.aspx" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-US/library/jj819267.aspx">SharePoint Online Service Description</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This article contains a lot of information regarding the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Differences in features across Office 365 plans.</li>
<li>Subscription options.</li>
<li>SharePoint Online boundaries and limits.</li>
<li>Differences in features across standalone plans.</li>
<li>Differences in features across on-premise solutions (Differences between: SharePoint Foundation, Standard and Enterprise).</li>
</ul>
