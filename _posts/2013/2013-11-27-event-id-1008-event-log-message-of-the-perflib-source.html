<p>When I was setting up a new SharePoint environment this week I was getting very annoyed about perflib error messages within the event log:</p>
<p><em>“The Open Procedure for service "WmiApRpl" in DLL "C:\Windows\system32\wbem\wmiaprpl.dll" failed. Performance data for this service will not be available. The first four bytes (DWORD) of the Data section contains the error code.”</em></p>
<p>Looking on TechNet I found the below article for fixing the problem.</p>

</ul>
<p>Taking these steps made no change. After that I was getting more annoyed and called a colleague for advice. He pointed to me that another colleague had already blogged about this a few months ago.</p>
<p>Take a look at his blog post to fix this issue:</p>
