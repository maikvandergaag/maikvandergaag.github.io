<p>For a current project I had to deploy some generated lists (stp templates) on another version of SharePoint (Dutch version). Because I’m a beginning programmer in SharePoint I didn’t know that that would cause a problem. Deploying generated list files or sites cannot be deployed to a SharePoint environment in another language.</p>
<p>I could upload the files but using the list template wasn’t able because it was created in another LocaleID. I googled and I found a really useful tool for converting stp template files.</p>
<p>The tool is called .STP Language Converter and can be downloaded from this site:</p>
