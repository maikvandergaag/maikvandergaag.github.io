<p>The <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/spdisposecheck">SPDisposeCheck v14.0.4762.1000</a> was updated and released 12/13/2010.&nbsp; </p>
<p>SPDisposeCheck is a tool that helps developers and administrators check custom SharePoint solutions that use the SharePoint Object Model helping measure against known Microsoft dispose best practices. This tool may not show all memory leaks in your code and may produce false positives which need further review by subject matter experts.</p>
<p>The SPDisposeCheck updated tool remains a standalone command line utility and weâ€™ve added a Visual Studio 2008/2010 IDE Add-In which calls out to the SPDisposeCheck.&nbsp; This Add-In was originally presented at the SPC 2009 and is now available publically.&nbsp; In addition this version has been tested with both WSS 3.0 + MOSS 2007 and SharePoint 2010 (Foundation and Server) environments.</p>
