<p>For a current project I had to figure out how to place information in a list in SharePoint when you are creating a new site from a site template and place documents in a document library.</p>
<p>After a lot of searching on the internet I found some helpful stuff. Placing initial information in a list can also be found on the MSDN site.</p>
<p>First step is to create a new site definition. This can be done by copying an out of the box Template and adjusting it the way you would like it to be. More information about creating a site definition you can find at:</p>
<p>http://www.sharepointblogs.com/tbaginski/archive/2007/08/16/creating-a-custom-site-definition-in-wss-v3-moss.aspx</p>
<p>This can also be a helpful link:</p>

<p>The way for placing initial information in a SharePoint list is done by finding the right list in the onet.xml were in you would like to place the information.</p>
<p>For example you have to find a tag in your ONET.xml like the one below:</p>
<pre class="highlight"> &lt;!--List information--&gt;
 &lt;List FeatureId=&quot;1BFC6CD6-4941-4964-A143-25E62AAEF642&quot; Type=&quot;107&quot; Title=&quot;Taken&quot; Url=&quot;Lists/Taken&quot; QuickLaunchUrl=&quot;Lists/Taken/AllItems.aspx&quot; &gt;&lt;/List&gt;</pre>
<p>For placing information in that list you have to know the columns that that list uses and place it between the &lt;list&gt; and &lt;/list&gt; with the &lt;data&gt; tag.</p>
<pre class="highlight">&lt;!--Inserting initial information--&gt;
 &lt;List FeatureId=&quot;1BFC6CD6-4941-4964-A143-25E62AAEF642&quot; Type=&quot;107&quot; Title=&quot;Taken&quot; Url=&quot;Lists/Taken&quot; QuickLaunchUrl=&quot;Lists/Taken/AllItems.aspx&quot; &gt;
 &lt;Data&gt;
  &lt;Rows&gt;
   &lt;Row&gt;
    &lt;Field Name=&quot;Title&quot;&gt;Task 1&lt;/Field&gt;
   &lt;/Row&gt;
   &lt;Row&gt;
    &lt;Field Name=&quot;Title&quot;&gt;Task 2&lt;/Field&gt;
   &lt;/Row&gt;
   &lt;Row&gt;
    &lt;Field Name=&quot;Title&quot;&gt;Task 3&lt;/Field&gt;
   &lt;/Row&gt;
   &lt;Row&gt;
    &lt;Field Name=&quot;Title&quot;&gt;Task 4&lt;/Field&gt;
   &lt;/Row&gt;
   &lt;Row&gt;
    &lt;Field Name=&quot;Title&quot;&gt;Task 5&lt;/Field&gt;
   &lt;/Row&gt;
  &lt;/Rows&gt;
 &lt;/Data&gt;
 &lt;/List&gt;</pre>
<p>This example will place five new lines in the Task list with all different titles. If you would like to fill in more items for a task, you would just have to add more field items between a row tag. Placing documents into a site is done a little bit different.</p>
<p>For placing these documents in the right document library you have to add a folder to you site definition with a name you are just thinking off. For this example I choice the folder name doctemp. To place the documents into a document library you have to make a module in the onet.xml file. And add it to the right configuration. </p>
<p>WordDocuments is the name I created for my module. You have to specify the module at the end of the onet.xml between the &lt;modules&gt; tag just before the end tag of projects. The module you could enter there could be something like this:</p>
<pre class="highlight"> &lt;!--Inplementing module--&gt;
 &lt;Module Name=&quot;WordDocuments&quot; List=&quot;101&quot; Url=&quot;Documents&quot; Path=&quot;docTemp&quot;&gt;
 &lt;File Name=&quot;Test.doc&quot;  Url=&quot;Test.doc&quot; Type=&quot;GhostableInLibrary&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;/Module&gt;</pre>
<p>The explanation of the used properties: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name:</strong> The name of the module.
</li>
<li><strong>List:</strong> The list type of the list were you would like to insert the documents.
</li>
<li><strong>Url: </strong>The URL to the list were you would like to insert the documents.
</li>
<li><strong>Path: </strong>The path to the files
</li>
<li><strong>File Name:</strong> The file name you would like to use.
</li>
<li><strong>File Url:</strong> The file name you would like to insert.
</li>
<li><strong>Type GhostableInLibrary: </strong>tells SharePoint to put an entry in the document library for this file, but this file will not be stored in the database it will stay on the file system.</li>
</ul>
<p>So now you are ready to make a site template with initial information.</p>
